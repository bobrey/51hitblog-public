      Thank you so much for the advice. I am very happy that someone has listened to me. It feels great to be heard and I don&amp;#8217;t know what I would do without that advice. It made me feel like I&amp;#8217;m not crazy for loving what I love. You&amp;#8217;re truly amazing and thank you for making me take notice to the work that I&amp;#8217;ve been doing. Your letter will stay in my mind forever.

      Thank you so very, very much. I really appreciate your sound advice. I am glad you gave me suggestions on how to write my email. I never know the approach to take. You solved it for me. I will let you know how things turn out. So grateful for you taking your time for my dilemma. God bless. Annie

      Thank you so much for your kind words! I really appreciate the supportive advice you&amp;#8217;ve given, it&amp;#8217;s just lately I&amp;#8217;ve been missing him so so much. It&amp;#8217;s so hard to let go of four years being together. I know deep down that we both have our own things we need to sort out on our own. I just wish it ended a better way and we could be friends&amp;#8230; But you are amazing! All the best! Xoxo

Since I took your advice the problems I previously had have gotten much better. If it were not for you, I do not know if I would be as happy as I am right now. Thank-you so much!

    &lt;hr /&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      Wow, thank you so much! This is really good advice and I didn&amp;#8217;t think of it that way, it more than likely is a much nicer alternative to my parents eyes. Though I may need to build up my case I am glad I have that as a new or backup idea. Thank you so much for your help it was really great! 😀
    &lt;/p&gt;

      Thank you for your quick response and your advice, it&amp;#8217;s much appreciated.

    &lt;hr /&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      Your reply was brutally honest, and I loved it for that reason. Somewhere down in me I too have a feeling that I should move on. I am ignoring her completely (for my own sake) for a while now and she too has responded in the same manner. I will like to add that I was not attracted towards her because she was a dangerous game (As both our fathers know each other and I never meant to join this organization). Thank you so much for your response. Best, Shivam

      Thank you so much for your help! I&amp;#8217;m a bit disappointed in myself for having forgotten to reply with a thank you so&amp;#8230;thank you! Haha, I&amp;#8217;ve decided to attempt to get a job at a local book/antique shop near my school. I believe it best fits my personality and my work ethics. And I was very grateful for your long and detailed answer so again thank you so much!
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;hr /&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      I greatly appreciate you willing to take the time to answer my letter. Your advice was if great help and I will make decisions with God on my side. Thank you for everything! I hope you find yourself in prosperity.

      Thank you very much Josmo, for your advice. In a way, I guess, it&amp;#8217;s a compliment &amp;#8211;the kids wanting us all to themselves. But I do find this behavior, when it comes to company, selfish, on their part and my husband&amp;#8217;s. The

      Thank you very much for your advice. I have deactivated all my social networking sites and stuck to this schedule for the week. It has really relieved some of my stress and I have been able to speak to my teachers and mum about my chosen career path who have given me some great advice.

      Thank you very much GranJan. I was confused, and I couldn&amp;#8217;t find a logic which digests for me. Yes, then you told me about the little kid thing inside me, and thats pretty understandable&amp;#8230;.thank you very much for you time&amp;#8230;.

      Thank you. I would like counseling to bee able to talk to him but he wouldn&amp;#8217;t go to counseling. He thinks one girl is annoying for saying her and her husband need it. So he would make me feel stupid for asking. But i can try. Your advice really helped me think. Thank you so much 🙂

      Oh my gosh. Thank you. All this time I&amp;#8217;ve only been thinking of a way to have a successful career that I enjoy instead of just doing what I enjoy regardless of its success. This was a real eye opener, and now I feel I can finally write without feeling like I&amp;#8217;m wasting my time on a pipe dream.
    &lt;/p&gt;

I&amp;#8217;ll figure out how to set myself up in the near future to be able to get those needed skills. It&amp;#8217;s definitely going to take a long time, and it&amp;#8217;s going to be rough, and I&amp;#8217;m going to confused a lot, but it&amp;#8217;s what&amp;#8217;s necessary.

      Elder Sanjean, I don&amp;#8217;t think you understand how much I appreciate your response. Origionally, I was actually searching for a local therapist. Unfortunately where I live, they&amp;#8217;re extremely expensive. I came across this website and didn&amp;#8217;t expect much out of it. I&amp;#8217;m surprised to see that what y&amp;#8217;all are doing here is genuine. I will put your advise into action starting with work tomorrow. I appreciate it a lot. Paris

      I just want to say thank you for your advice, after I sat and spoke to my mother I felt releaved, like a great burden was lifted even though she did already know. But I would like to say thanks for taking the time and reply in this hard time in my life. I have taken all consequences and I feel like my mother and i&amp;#8217;s relationship is to eventually grow. So thank you, and God bless you.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      Thank you so much for your advice. I ended up talking to my math teacher about this, and he helped me work something out. I have a conference with my mom and and my teacher on Tuesday after-school, and my teacher said he would explain to my mom that I am doing really well, and not to put too much pressure on me. Thank you, so so so much. I am very grateful for your advice.

    &lt;hr /&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      Thank you so much Katrina. I am actually feeling a lot better and am starting to put myself out there again. I actually ran into my ex yesterday and can say that I honestly think I&amp;#8217;m 95% over him and definitely wouldn&amp;#8217;t want to get back together. Your words meant a lot and I will particularly take note of the advice that I have to treat myself as a priority. Thank you again, Gemma.

      Thank you Janna. It has been a long road and I have stuck with it but now feel I have come to the end of that road, and it is truly helpful to have an independent person validate my conclusion.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;hr /&gt;

      Thank you very much for this advice.Iam extremely thankful. I&amp;#8217;m finally realizing that he isn&amp;#8217;t the only guy in the world. I really needed someone to listen to my story and I finally got that. So thank you!

    &lt;hr /&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      Thank you for the advice. And reading the letter I made I saw that it made it look like I wanted Jordan&amp;#8230;..but after reading your reply..i saw that I had to make the right choice instead of the wrong one. So I chose Luke and that I feel was the best choice I ever made. Thank you so much for that advice. You just made my life a whole lot better 🙂
    &lt;/p&gt;

      Your advice on my letter was exactly what i needed and i dont think anyone could have given better advice. I havent talked to my dad since christmas but i invited him to go to dinner tonight and that we may be able to do that maybe once a month to get comfortable around him again and not so much attatchment. Thank you again for the advice it was so much apprecitaed!
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      Thank you very much, and I do realize that I can&amp;#8217;t exactly change her myself now. but I think I can help her a bit and make her realize that not many things in life are acheived. Also, thank you for the tips on the band I will definitely use them! 😉

      Many thanks for your reply. You&amp;#8217;re entirely right, but I&amp;#8217;m sure you understand some outside perspective can be really helpful. I;&amp;#8217;ll consider my options about the group, but I&amp;#8217;ve apologised to several members. Once again thanks for your help! I shall consider consulting you should I need to again.

      Thank you very much for your advice, Elder Ketchman. I&amp;#8217;ll be sure to do as you suggested and discuss the best options with my financial advisors, and hearing about your friend whose life improved during life on campus is very encouraging.

      Thank you so much! You really got to the core of it for me&amp;#8211;I do want to move because it will be so much sunnier and cheerier. This is a wonderful service. It&amp;#8217;s so lovely to have an outsider&amp;#8217;s view. Take care.

    &lt;p&gt;
      Thank you so much for replying to me. It really helped and I haven&amp;#8217;t been in contact with my ex boyfriend and starting to feel a lot better and just enjoying life. I felt a bit sick before because I was involved in something so heavy and awful. I feel so much better and your feedback helped me in making the right decision. Thank you, I hope you have a lovely Christmas.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;hr /&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      thank you for your advice it really makes me feel better because I have been holding in how I felt for a very long time. I know its not always good to bite your tongue when something is on your mind. but I can say I will take your advice on being happy, successful,completing my education, and telling my mom that I miss her.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;hr /&gt;

      Miss JanLynn, Your advice was fantastic. Talking to my primary care physician is spot on especially since I have known him since I was a teenager and he has gone this route as well. I really appreciate your wisdom in this matter. Thank you so much. V/r Sam Jaynes

      Thank you. I don&amp;#8217;t talk to my parents anymore so it&amp;#8217;s nice to know y&amp;#8217;all even exist. That makes a lot of sense.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;hr /&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      My supervisor told me the same thing about learning the position and growing into it. I know it&amp;#8217;s not always about the money. It&amp;#8217;s nice to hear an unbiased opinion. Great thanks and have a wonderful Holiday Season. Stefanie

      Thank you so much! What I did was told him we needed a break&amp;#8230;I needed a break to think about things. I&amp;#8217;ve thought about it and I&amp;#8217;ve decided to permanently end the relationship. I wasn&amp;#8217;t feeling good in it at all. Anyway thank you so much what you wrote me makes perfect sense and again thanks, I&amp;#8217;m very greatful 🙂
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;hr /&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      THANK YOU!I think I just wanted to have confirmation on what I was feeling. I will definitely not communicate with him on this level again. I am sure that I will need advice in the future and will check on how to send a donation for The ElderWisdomCircle for I think it probably helps alot of people. Talk soon and thank you again. Diane

      Hey Steffie, thank you so much for that advice! 🙂 It helped a lot, now I can see there&amp;#8217;s no point in worrying about such stuff. I&amp;#8217;ll go ahead and take care of my skin, if it seems needed. There&amp;#8217;s nothing that wrong with it. And if you&amp;#8217;ll like to know, I went and confessed my love for that that guy, now there isn&amp;#8217;t much problem with him haunting my thoughts! 🙂

    &lt;hr /&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      Thank you for your excellent advice. This situation is very difficult and sensitive and it helps me greatly to see it all laid out logically. I showed my boyfriend your response and he agreed that it makes sense. This will make my decision significantly easier.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      Thanks for your advise. I knew the child was going to be the biggest part of it. Your letter back gave me lots to think about. The father ditched her as soon as she found out she was pregnant. I don&amp;#8217;t know about her parents yet. Thanks again!
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;hr /&gt;

      Thank you so much for your time and advice. We came to the conclusion to remain friends, and leave it at that, for the simple sake that both of us have much going on in our futures. School wise, I&amp;#8217;m just starting, and he&amp;#8217;s fixing to graduate soon, so its best to remain friends.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      Thanks Barbara for your advice. I am on a road to heal it is nice to have this help. It is exhausting for those closest to us to listen to our woes and this site gives us an outlet to help us reflect.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      I&amp;#8217;ll never forget your kindness and your understanding. Although I&amp;#8217;m still learning them, your words were like an epiphany somehow. You&amp;#8217;ve helped me, and will continue to help me (I re-read your advice and reassurance whenever I need to)in so many different ways. And thanks for the tip about reading Julia Cameron&amp;#8217;s The Prosperous Heart. I&amp;#8217;e just begun that book and am glad to have the right ideas in my life at exactly the right time. Thank you. I emailed this website expecting nothing &amp;#8211; or maybe cliches and platitudes. What you gave me was so much more than I expected and I am eternally grateful to you for that. I wish you all the very best and so much more. Take care and funny, too, that the name &amp;#8216;Green Man&amp;#8217; took me back to my childhood. I associate it with Newcastle but have no idea why. All the best and thank you for your time and genuine understanding.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;hr /&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      Thanks for the kind words, i really appreciate them. The website you linked however does not work outside the USA even the chat function so i couldn&amp;#8217;t use it. But just getting the advice made me feel a little better inside, thanks a lot. ;D
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;hr /&gt;

      Jane, thanks for a fast straight forward answer. It wasn&amp;#8217;t what I wanted to hear, but what I needed to hear. And for what its worth. I agree with your answer.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;hr /&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      Your response had me in tears. I was afraid of what I was going to hear but when I was done reading I had, and still have, so much hope for getting better, feeling better. Thank you from the bottom of my heart, I am so grateful for the caring I have found.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;hr /&gt;

      I do have to say it&amp;#8217;s such a lovely and brilliant idea to have this opportunity to interact with kind, experienced and wise people. thanks, ewa

      This was a well thought out letter with great advice. Very insightful that you realized I was ready to move on from support groups into actual social settings. I will try the advice u mentioned. Again, it was great. And, thank you for your wisdom! Dana

      Hi SuzannaRoseanna, Thank you for such a detailed and well-thought out reply. It was wonderful to get sound and realistic advice from someone who is not as close to the situation as I am. I now have my options and possible courses of action laid out before me and will consider what is best to do and keep your letter as a reference I will start by reaching out to the neighbor who has already contacted the noisemakers. Thank you so very, very much. Your advice is MUCH appreciated! Laura

      Ruth, I cannot thank you enough for your fast and great advice. You have really helped me to see that I don&amp;#8217;t deserve to get treated badly even my family. I now realize I should only include people in my life that really care about me and respect me as a person. Thank you again and I am so grateful for your advice! Kristy

      I wanted to thank you for the &amp;#8220;direct&amp;#8221; approach. Not only did I tell him to leave and that it was over&amp;#8230;.. I sought professional help. This enlightenment really hit home for both of us. Kind of an &amp;#8220;Ah ha&amp;#8221; moment. Our relationship is now on the mend and we are happy. You gave great advice. Thank you
    &lt;/p&gt;

      This was more helpful than I can say. It enabled me to get past my hurt feelings and see things a little more clearly. I don&amp;#8217;t want to throw away a longtime friendship over this. Yes, i&amp;#8217;m disappointed. But i&amp;#8217;ll move on. Thank you so much!! jo

      Thank you so much. When I wrote in I was doing so with tears in my eyes and hurt in my heart. I finally mustered up the courage to tell him it&amp;#8217;s over and he needs to move out. He belittled me by telling me there is no perfect relationship out there, but your advice provided me with hope. The hope I needed to tell him that I have faith.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      Thank you so incredibly much for your response. I honestly didn&amp;#8217;t know how well this website was, but just wanted to give it a shot. I could not have asked for a better response to this. It feels so incredible to have somebody that seems to understand my situation so well. Never have I had somebody to fully understand and give me great advice. I will be using every bit of this advice. I actually feel now like I have a good chance at resolving my problems. Thank you so much for everything. I won&amp;#8217;t forget it. -Jordan

      Wow, thank you Charlie. You say that you are not a heavy thinker but you have certainly given me much to think about. I wondered if I was answering my own question, as we often do, before I sent it but I decided to send it anyway knowing that sometimes others pick up on the things we don&amp;#8217;t say. And I am glad I did send because clearly my caretaker burnout came through. So thank you for speaking to it because I found your advice very helpful especially the part about the role choosing me. I have been wrestling with this with respect to my purpose and working on having compassion for both myself and others after having become resentful indeed. Realizing my own growth was stagnated I began do the spiritual work to release and free up some internal resources. However, you have affirmed for me a sense I had that it might not be what I am doing as much as the way I was going about it that has led to the burnout. FYI: I gave some money based on what I could afford b/c his assets were frozen and he really did need it so I feel ok about it. I realize now that I also gave lots of advice along with it which probably didn&amp;#8217;t help. Going forward I will try this new perspective of letting others solve their problems by asking them questions instead of giving advice. You have helped me understand why this is the best for us both and I also think it will help address the dependency without me disengaging totally which is where my resentment was leading me. Again, thank you!

      Elder Emme &amp;#8211; I read your reply to an LGBT man. Your love and compassion made me cry. I&amp;#8217;ve experienced a lot of hate and bullying directed at the LGBT community and it often felt to me that there was an age limit on acceptance. You are a wonderful person.

      Elder KatrinaK, Tonight you have made another human being who is very much real (in the U.K) feel that he&amp;#8217;s not alone and there are people who care. You have given me hope (and I don&amp;#8217;t even know you) and courage and strength that a lot of people turn to God for. Thank you and best wishes for everything.

      Dear Priscilla, You replied to my message and I just wanted to say thank you so much. We are no longer together, he said that we can &amp;#8220;take a break&amp;#8221; and get back together when we have more time, but I know that having no time is not the problem &amp;#8211; I&amp;#8217;m just not ready for a relationship! So I&amp;#8217;m going to tell him that. So, thanks to you and another response (unfortunately it found its way into my junk mail folder, and was gone before I could get the name to thank the other person who helped) I have decided that I&amp;#8217;m just going to have some time to myself, finish Uni, get a job and find a flat somewhere alone to figure things out. So thank you, your advice was greatly appreciated. Keep up the good work
    &lt;/p&gt;

      I received an email two years ago from Elder Alexandra, it was in regards to University and struggling to make choices.. I wasn&amp;#8217;t in the best frame of mind and needed guidance. Thanks to Alexandra I was accepted to College for a Diploma in Higher Education (Business) and will be progressing into 3rd Year of my BA Hons in Human Resource Management and Marketing from Strathclyde University. I really just wanted to take this opportunity to let Alexandra that their advice really did help me. I plan to finish my degree and get a little more experience in my field before I decide to go travelling. This website has provided me with advice that will stay with me for many many years to come. What a joy to know that there are people out there that care and will listen. I thank Alexandra for the help they gave me, it has been invaluable in deciding where my future is going. Thank you, Susan
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;hr /&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      Hello Alexandra, I&amp;#8217;m just writing back to thank you kindly for your advice. It made a lot of sense to me and some of the things you mentioned, about feelings becoming overwhelming and coming across as needy and dependant and the insecurity for asking her questions were spot on. The feelings were/are overwhelming, and I do feel insecure because of how my mind wanders and makes me believe things that i&amp;#8217;m only seeing in my head. I&amp;#8217;m glad I found the site, and i&amp;#8217;m glad I made my submission. It was a first step for me to try and understand what i&amp;#8217;m doing wrong and how I can better myself in future. I really cannot thank you enough for your advice. It has helped me to feel more at ease, and makes me realise that there are very kind people in the world who are there to help you when you have no one else. As I said, I can&amp;#8217;t thank you enough. This world needs more people like you and the other elders, it would make it a much better place. Many, many thanks and kind regards. John.

      Dear Elder BG: Thank you so much for responding in such a timely manor. I talked to my volunteer fire chief tonight and unfortunately he said it was out of his hands and he couldnt just let come back. He said the only option he has to offer is talk to the members as a department and explain my situation and basically ask the department to let me come back&amp;#8230;I do see a counselor. I was seeing her continuously prior to my girlfriends departure for basic training. I have not seen my counselor until just last week and had a lot of catching up to do with her. I just hope and pray my peers on the fire department will understand and allow me to rejoin. and when she comes back home maybe i can fire up that spark again between us by helping her and just being there for her like I used to be.Show her that I really do love her and how much she means to me. But in the meantime Take this time off to concentrate on myself and show her that I really can make something of myself. Thanks again for you response. It really means a lot to me that people such as yourself are really out there and willing to help! Thank you
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;hr /&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      Elder BG, I thank you very much for your time. i will do some research into looking for help. I appreciate all the advice. the advice you gave is so hard to except but it also seems to be the right way in life. I cried throughout this email reading what you wrote and your so right. I never had anyone ever tell me this before. It really is tough love and it something I have to face myself and learn a new healthy way to life. I need to stop letting others control my emotions and just feel confident in my own life and my own feelings without letting others effect me. I&amp;#8217;m so glad I came here for help, you gave me the best advice i think i ever herd. I will keep your email to remind me of your encouraging words, it strengthens me. The part about distancing myself from my family and living my own life and how out of all of them i am the most successful is so right, i guess i just let their bad behavior and judgment and mean words effect me. And your also right that they know my weaknesses, they really do because they use them against me all the time. The part about my friend passing away, possibly could have passed away if I picked up the phone. I need to just except things tough times in my life and learn to deal with them mentally, in a strong way. I do need to open up more to people who are there to help me, and your right it might break me out of my shell. I seriously thank you from the bottom of my heart for your advice and I will seek the links and groups and suggestions you have gave me. I really do just feel so much better. Your a wonderful person and very understanding. thank you so much. please take care and please know you really did help me. Tapanga

      Dear Charlie I am really pleasantly surprised by your prompt, thoughtful response. Your kind words brought a tear to my eye. I have been for counselling in the past, but I think you are right in sayingthat I clearly need more help. Goodness knows, I am so ready to have this tooth pulled! What I found most helpful about your letter, was your question about my reluctance based on my marriage or the shooting. No one has actually ever put it to me that plainly. I think it was the marriage and not the shooting, which took place not too long after my divorce. I was heartbroken over loosing my friend, but he was an absolute gentleman who treated me like gold. Unfortunately, the same can not be said about my husband, who is also the father of my three children. Thank you again for your valuable advice. Kind regards
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;hr /&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      Maryanne, I greatly appreciate your understanding and willingness to share your advice with me. I really needed to hear everything you told me, because whether or not I already knew it deep down, it helped me more than you know. Thank you so much for giving me the confidence that I am doing the right thing. It gives me hope that there are people like you that are so willing to help, one day I will join this website and try to help people like you do. I will try to get her help with our school councilor and our church. It&amp;#8217;ll be very very hard but I know that I can get through it. Your advice means a lot and thank you very much for your kind words.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      I came across this email I must have saved from almost two years ago. I read thru it again and remembered why I had saved it. I don&amp;#8217;t know if I ever replied or said thank you to Jackie. I find that even though my life is in a different place now than it was then, the relationship advice I received from her is solid and still applies today. Thank you for the uplifting affirmation, encouragement, and truthful advice.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      Dear Charlie, Thank you. If you were in any doubt what you are doing for the elderwisdom circle, it is a wonderful thing that you do. The help you have given me is more valuable than I can express. Thank you for your insight, kind words and compassion Please take care of yourself. Sarah

      Elder Charlie: I would like to thank you for your precious time in understanding my problem and providing adequate guidance in no time. My special thanks to EWC for offering such a wonderful service to people in need! I will recommend this portal to others who need help and will come back here again in case I need any advice in future. All good wishes to you Charlie. May God bless you. Best regards, Priya.

      Thank you so much for what you did for me all those years ago EWC, I honestly was at the edge and I don&amp;#8217;t think I would be here today if it wasn&amp;#8217;t for your sincere and caring guidance and advice. Keep up the wonderful work!

      Dear Helen, I found your advice reply e-mail again that you sent on 29 July 2010. I just wanted to say that I have listened to your advice and followed my heart on the issue and have healed from the relationship that didn&amp;#8217;t work out. Yes, it did take more than two years, but it feels good to be on the other side of that. I&amp;#8217;m ready to meet someone new and have communicated my desires to the universe. What a wonderful service you provide! Thanks again. Best wishes, JJ

      Windancer-This was wonderful advice, thank you. Mentioning that we have higher standards for strangers than friends was something I had not even thought of, and it seems very true, especially in the case os my boyfriend. I appreciate you validating my concerns. Thank you for you time,

      Alexandra &amp;#8211; I just want to thank the elders who answered my request for advice. I think their advice was well thought out, sound and correct. This is the second time I&amp;#8217;ve used Elder Wisdom Cirle and I have told many friends about it. It really helps just to sit down and write your problems out. And receiving an objective opinion really helps you to feel not so &amp;#8220;alone&amp;#8221; in your problems. Thanks again. You guys are GREAT!
    &lt;/p&gt;

      Dear Elder RipRap &amp;#8211; Thank you so much. You really helped a lot. I am starting to lower my stress more and more. Your reply really meant a lot. Thank you !

    &lt;p&gt;
      Dear Elder Alexandra &amp;#8211; I&amp;#8217;d like to thank you so much. You don&amp;#8217;t understand how much this actually means to me. Although I don&amp;#8217;t really like therapists ill consider giving it a try. You reply helped me give advice to a young man who&amp;#8217;s also under a lot of stress. And it felt good, he told me that I&amp;#8217;m the only person he can trust and that I actually made him smile in the longest amount of time. That filled my stomach with this relieving or even somewhat of a serene feeling. It felt nice to help him. I&amp;#8217;d say god bless your soul but I&amp;#8217;m Buddhist so, I hope you have a blissful life ahead for you. I saved this email so I can remember that there are people like you in this world that were put here for a reason. You are truly an angel sent down to earth and I will never forget you, for as long as I live.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      Dear Elder M_Markie &amp;#8211; thank you so much. this was really lovely and inspiring, and I think it was probably just what I needed to hear. I wish you all the best, and hope you can brighten other people&amp;#8217;s days as much as you have mine 🙂

      Dear Elder Jangela &amp;#8211; Thank you for your advice, Jangela. That was exactly what I&amp;#8217;ve been thinking, but hearing it coming from someone who&amp;#8217;s not emotionally involved in this situation has helped me feel like I&amp;#8217;m being at least somewhat rational about all of this insanity. I wish I&amp;#8217;d found EWC sooner. Thank you again!

      Dear Elder Tell-Tom &amp;#8211; Thank you so much for your words of wisdom! I know I deserve better-I guess I just needed to hear it from an objective third party. I think I will put this whole mess in the history books and move on with my life! I really appreciate your prompt reply and hope you know how much it means to me! It feels so good to get this monkey off my back:)

      Hello, Miss Wendy! You probably don&amp;#8217;t remember my situation but I just wanted to thank you for your help! I got my best guy friend a present and told him how sorry I was for being mean to him and he genuinely loved the gift and currently we are talking like normal again. And he actually texted me in which I felt like he cared so I&amp;#8217;ve been really happy and I hope this lasts! Thank you so much for your help and I&amp;#8217;m going to keep trying not to ruin things and I&amp;#8217;m so glad you helped me out! You are a wonderful person! Thank you!

      Dear Elder BG &amp;#8211; I just wanna say thank you for the help! Thinks have been really crazy and stressful in my life lately and I&amp;#8217;m hoping what you said will help. I think I really needed someone wise to talk to about my whole depression. And when I&amp;#8217;m ready, which I hope is soon I&amp;#8217;m going to talk to my parents about what&amp;#8217;s going on. Thank you so much again.

      Dear Elder Charlie &amp;#8211; Thank you so much for your reply. It does give me some hope to hold on to. I just keep telling myself patience is a virtue. Sometimes more than once. But thank you so much. I often felt I didnt have anyone to go to I have friends and family but sometimes you need someone elses point of view. So thanks again. I will be writing back.

      Dear Elder Aunt-Molly &amp;#8211; Thank you, Aunt-Molly. I do appreciate your response and it has been most helpful. It is too difficult to talk to family members about this situation, and talking to you via this forum, has been just what I needed. I can&amp;#8217;t begin to tell you how much I appreciate your help. Thanks so much!!

      Dear Elder Alexandra &amp;#8211; Hi I recently asked the ElderWisdomCircle for advice and opinions for a problem I had and I&amp;#8217;m really glad I sent my email. The response was clearly well thought out and I&amp;#8217;m really happy with the answer I received! Thank you for all your help &amp;#8211; it&amp;#8217;s given me lots to think about and a totally new perspective on the way I viewed my situation.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;hr /&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      Alexandra: Your advice helped tremendously. You really helped a lot. I know you probably give out advice to tons of people, but it really did help. You have no idea how great it feels to know someone cares. I literally had tears of joy in my eyes. If your job is to help people, you&amp;#8217;re doing a fantastic job. Thank you so much again for taking time out of your day to help someone like me.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;hr /&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      I want to thank you all so much for all that you have helped with. You are such a blessing. I find myself with no one to turn to except God. And asking for advice from you all helps so much. Thank you for all the help. You all are so great!
    &lt;/p&gt;

      Hi kay, I would like to thank you for your swift reply and your words of wisdom, as i said in my letter &amp;#8211; i do not have any elders to turn to in times of trouble&amp;#8230;&amp;#8230;&amp;#8230;.. but i now have the EWC to provide me with the tools and help that i need! Yourself and all others at the EWC are making a big difference to many people&amp;#8217;s life&amp;#8217;s and I beileve that you are a godsend, i no longer feel alone and helpless. I thank you from the bottom of my heart.

      Thank you, Cousin-B (and all the elders)! This is such a WONDEFUL service and each response has always been heartfelt, sincere, and not-generic. I&amp;#8217;ve referred many people to you. 🙂 Thank you again. I appreciate your response and will take your advice to heart. Have an amazing day&amp;#8211;what you do is admirable, worthwhile, and much appreciated.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      Dear JanLynn: Wonderful advice. You make VERY valid points. I think I will follow, as I too have been thinking those same thoughts already. Thank you so much, sometimes it&amp;#8217;s just nice to hear someone else confirm my thoughts. I will be adding you on facebook, and taking the survey giving nothing but praise.

      Dear Elder Teresa, Thank you for your words. Your advice is counter intuitive, but it&amp;#8217;s what I needed! You confirm what the &amp;#8220;little voice in my heart&amp;#8221; has been guiding me to. I&amp;#8217;m grateful this day to have your wisdom, as one who can identify with my situation. Most importantly, I value the resources you offered me. Slowly, I&amp;#8217;m attempting to get rid of the &amp;#8220;Cinderella complex,&amp;#8221; as I&amp;#8217;ll call it. I have stopped believing in&amp;#8221; happily ever after&amp;#8221; little by little, and I&amp;#8217;m mourning my dream of being a princess. I needed new perspective to start to move on from my mourning. Thank you again! Merry Christmas,
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;hr /&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      [Note: This came 4 years after the advice was given.] I was going through my old emails and found this. I started crying reading it again. What memories it brought back. I just wanted to say thank you again. I followed the advice given. It took about 5 months, but I did it. Once I got over the pain in my heart, I seen things a little clearer and stopped blameing myself. I am happy now.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;hr /&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      Thank you, i am feeling much better after this. and i think its nice to have some one the understands. i cant thank you enough. i have asked my mother to spend time together and now were going shoping together today. thank you![:
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;hr /&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      Thank you for your advice. It was encouraging to hear from an outside source what I have been hearing from friends and family, which, because of the uninterested nature, gives a sense of greater validity. I am doing what I can to find a bit more &amp;#8220;me&amp;#8221; time and learning to say no when I have to. Thank you for being able to listen and give a thoughtful reply. It is greatly appreciated.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      Hi grandma You wouldn&amp;#8217;t mind me calling u grandma will u? Its just i never really had a grandma before who would give me such suggestions. And really thank you so much. I hadn&amp;#8217;t thought the idea of leaving home all the way through and now i see how much dependent i am on my parents. And i never thought about me being loney either. I am going to do my homework of thinking through the pros and cons! Thank you so much. I feel like this huge stuffs has been lifted from my mind and i see the light coming through all the negativity inside me.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;hr /&gt;

      Thank you so much for your advice. It was very well written and helpful.

    &lt;p&gt;
      Thank you so much for your advice. I&amp;#8217;ve read it several times and I am continuing to absorb it. I will think very hard about the things you have mentioned. This website is wonderful and the advice is very helpful. Surely I will email again! I&amp;#8217;m happy these sorts of places exist because there are truly so many people who just need an outside source to give them some form of input.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;hr /&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      Thank You for the advice, I will use it wisely. I am so glad I found this site because it really helps. Thank You so much!

      Hedwig, Thank you so much for your thoughtful response. Your line about &amp;#8220;making right the choices that capture you&amp;#8221; really resonated with me. When I first read your response I really felt that the response was exactly what I needed to hear at this time in my life. Like a guardian angel! I have used Elder Wisdom Circle multiple times and have always had such excellent advice. What a wonderful service. Thank you for your committment to caring!
    &lt;/p&gt;

      Thank you for taking the time to offer your thoughts. You bring up many valid points. I appreciate your insight, your letter brought me tears.

    &lt;hr /&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      I just want to thank you for your advice! It was something I needed to hear but had no one to tell me. I almost cried as I got deeper into the message, everything you said made complete sense. I just wanted you to know I really appreciate your advice and I&amp;#8217;m going to keep writing this website when I come into problems that I need help. Sincerely, Mari

      Dear Jacobus, Thank you for your very well thought out and wise advise, I really appreciate it! My natural reaction to the situation would normally be to just keep on keeping on because I am adding to their lives and it&amp;#8217;s so much easier to not rock the boat. I must now value myself more and care about my happiness as well. Thank you again for the reinforcement and encouragement. Karen
    &lt;/p&gt;

      Dear PicklesMarie, I cannot thank you enough this time. You are exactly on target with what you think my main issues are. Kudos for this wonderful advice. I plan to start experimenting with the tips you gave me from today. You are absolutely right about the shyness problem. Thank you once again, you&amp;#8217;re great 🙂 Best Wishes Tanya

      This is an exceptionally kind and thoughtful response to my dilemma. I will take your advice under very serious consideration. I am very glad that you were there for me. Be well and continue to do good work.

      Thank you very much for this thought-provoking response, which I&amp;#8217;m still re-reading&amp;#8230;a lot of food for thought! I will write again and let you know how it goes.

    &lt;hr /&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      Thank you so much. Your letter was extremely helpful. You basically said what I have been thinking all this time but didn&amp;#8217;t quite realize it until it was put in words by someone else in front of me. Your words have given me the courage to do exactly what you said. Thank you so much again! 🙂
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;hr /&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      Thank you so much for the phone number, I&amp;#8217;m going to call right now. I&amp;#8217;m so happy you wrote back to me, it feels as if someone can hear me out. I&amp;#8217;m 18 and I have shut myself from all of my so-called friends because I feel this big hole in my chest, and every time I tried to talk about what was going on with me, my friends &amp;#8211; even my best friend &amp;#8211; didn&amp;#8217;t want to hear me out. Everyone just thinks about partying and hooking up and what to wear to the club for the weekend. I hate it. I hate it all. Thank you so much for this.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      Hello Barbara-Ann, Thank you so much for your swift and comprehensive response, I found your advice very helpful and intend to start following through on things today. I will drop you an email to let you know just how things are progressing. Thank you so much.

      Dear Michelle, I wanted to thank you for what you do at Elder Wisdom circle and for taking the time to do it. Thank you for reaching across the water (I am on the other side of the Atlantic!) and touching my heart with your wise words. It was very helpful for me to write things down and to read the calm clear response from you. Thank you again and I wish you the very best. Take care, kind regards
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;hr /&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      Oh, thank you so much! I just really love this website now! I really appreciate you taking the time, and also your advice is just so unbelievably helpful! I literally cannot wait to talk to him about this. Thanks for even considering helping me, I know that If I had spoken to anyone else in my life they probably would have thought this whole thing to be stupid and immature, even though it had really been bothering me. Thank you very much, you rock Wise-Old-Owl

      Hi Mimi, Thank you very much for your kind words and very helpful advise. I feel at times you wonder if you have the energy to keep trying especially as we both have our own business and dreams to follow. Sometimes you just loose faith and question if it&amp;#8217;s time to throw in the towel. I have to say though that not long after I wrote to you things took a turn in the right direction and my affections for him seem to be building again day by day. Very happy at the moment and I think we are over the worst and the holidays should seal it, put the past where it should be, behind us! and like you said move on with our relationship. Thank you again. Kindest regards
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;hr /&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      Mimi Thank you so much for the excellent advice. Sorry the response is so late; I had to have my computer fixed. But yes, your advice and kind words really helped me get through that difficult time. Thankfully, that specific issue has since been cleared up, and we are still together. Still having some complications here and there, but we&amp;#8217;re young, and that&amp;#8217;s to be expected! I thought it would be ridiculous of me to go on a website and request help with my relationship, mainly because of the fact that I&amp;#8217;m only fifteen and that there are plenty of other things to think about than relationships at my age. Yes&amp;#8230; I had plenty of doubts, but I just really felt like anything would help with at least filling the unknown with even a guess at that point. I was wrong to have any doubt. You gave me plenty of great words of wisdom, (the name of the site is very appropriate!), and I take them and apply them to many other situations as well. I like to think that I have a generally positive outlook on things, but since I read your response to my question, I really feel more strong and able to handle myself in cases like this, where I just have no clue at all. Again, I am very grateful to you for helping me in such a crazy situation. So a million thanks to you, Mimi. Really, I didn&amp;#8217;t know that I was capable of remaining calm and thinking rationally so soon after a problem occurs before! Thank you so much for your help. 🙂 -Holly

      thank you Hedwig, I finally went to my parents and sat them down..and said lets figure things out. So we talked about finances and other things. Like the forgetfulness. So we came up with a honey to list that will sit on the table and both of them will use. So they don&amp;#8217;t forget. I am not sure how the memory thing is. But we will start here and move on when nesscary. Thank you for the advice&amp;#8230;
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;hr /&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      I would like to thank you so much for your comforting words. They are things I have been trying to tell myself for the longest time, but hearing them from someone else truly makes all the difference. You really helped me find hope at the end of this, and it helps so much to know that there&amp;#8217;s someone out there that cares. So thanks again for everything(:
    &lt;/p&gt;

      Hello Elder Thank you very much. As much as I don&amp;#8217;t want to accept your advice, I know that what you say is right. I know I need to move on and I am going to do it. It is going to kill me but I know that this too shall pass. I am grateful for your advice and I am thankful.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      Hello to Elder Jacobus and all the Elders of Wisdom Circle, I would like to say thank you very much for your advice, it means the world to me and it has given me strength to move on. Thank you very much for replying me God bless you Elder jacobus and all the Elders of Wisdom Circle.

      Dear Aunt-Bella, Thank you for your reply and the thought you put into it. I was glad to hear your advice and to have many of the good pieces of advice already given to me by others reiterated. Sometimes another voice makes the right words clearer. I will continue to try my best at the university and to gain new perspectives and ideas which will not only give me a better understanding of the world, but also help me to perhaps figure out what route I should take&amp;#8211;maybe even one I hadn&amp;#8217;t considered before simply because I had not encountered it before! May you continue to live well and be able to give your advice to we who need it most!
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;hr /&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      Thank you so much for your kind words. I will take your advice to heart. If I have other questions I will ask you. Thank you- this is a great service.

      I will definately take your advice and see a counselor. I don&amp;#8217;t have a job so electrolysis is kind of out of the equation for now, but I&amp;#8217;m gonna look around a see what else I can find to help remove or permanantly remove the hair, and start saving up money for it. My boyfreind finally came home after a full 28 hours away and things have been &amp;#8220;civil&amp;#8221; i guess. We&amp;#8217;ve discussed it and he doesn&amp;#8217;t want counseling but I promised him it would never happen again, and he said he&amp;#8217;s gonna try to spend more time with me. He even cracked a joke afterwards saying the &amp;#8220;xbox 360 was his 1st girlfriend but he&amp;#8217;d make time for me also.&amp;#8221; That&amp;#8217;s alot different than things were when this all first happened. Thanks for guiding me in how to handle this. And p.s. If you aren&amp;#8217;t getting paid for this, you should be. I can only imagine the stuff that comes in for you to have to try to decipher and help straighten out. Thank you again
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;hr /&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      I want to thank you. Your reply has given me trust and hope in the world. I am still a little sad and screwed up but, thank you for all your help.

      Thank you so much for the prompt advice. I really needed some help on this particular issue and I was so surprised to see my advice so soon show up in my mailbox. Such wise, thoughtful and grounding advice! I feel so much better! Coming from such a dysfunctional family, I needed the advice of a wise elder! I definitately plan to donate to ElderWisdomCircle. What a wonderful site.

      Thank you Riprap. You have clearly put a substantial amount of thought into our situation and clearly care. Your pretty much right on the money and I have reread and taken on board all that you have to offer. I have confidence in a positive future for Shane, he is a beautiful person, just needs help focusing and keeping a balance between responsabilities and entertainment and finding healthy entertainment. I have taught him to open up and communicate with me, he has gotten a lot off his chest and feels so much relief. Yes, a helping hand from the right people will make life a bit clearer and more positive for both of us. Thanks again for the time and thoughts you have commited to your response to me, I appreciate it greatly. You&amp;#8217;re a gem.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;hr /&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      WOW!!!! I read this response like wow you put the nail in the hammer. You are absolutely right. I have been tolerating this type of behavior for far too long. I appreciate the straight forward response. I needed that from someone on the outside. I think this is a great site, I am glad my friend sent it to me. I will be forwarding it to all my friends. Hope it helps them. I will definitely be back. Have a great evening.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      Dear Alexandra, Thank you so much for your response. Your words were so reassuring. I printed your response and put it in my nightstand where I can read it on nights when I&amp;#8217;m feeling low. I actually do have an appointment with a counselor scheduled for this week, so hopefully that will help, too. But so many people in my life seem to feel that it&amp;#8217;s taking me too long to get over my divorce; it&amp;#8217;s wonderful to hear someone say that it&amp;#8217;s normal to take this long (or longer) and to even say that I should feel good about how far I&amp;#8217;ve come. Thank you again; I really appreciate you and the others who give their time for this service!
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;hr /&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;

      Thank you so much for your advice it made me feel a lot better. I did talk with my dad and he apologized to me and my sister and he has been trying to not over react at things as much. Again thank you. Hope you&amp;#8217;re well

      Joanie Wise,Thank you for your reply, I really appreciate your time. It may sound strange but I have NEVER put my feelings into words. Yourself and my fiancee are the only people I have opened up to in the world. Both in the same week and it does feel like a weight off my shoulders.I am in the process of seeking professional help with the support from my partner. So, this is a big thank you, personally, from me to you. I wish you all the best, and will personally recommend your website to anybody who may find it helpful. Thanks again
    &lt;/p&gt;

      Dear Cirrus, A few years ago, in 2008, I sought advice from this website and on 07/14/2008 you replied to me. I was 18 and I wanted advice about my horrid fear of loved ones dying. You sent me a beautiful reply which really helped me a lot. Since then, I have always focussed turning those negative feelings into positive actions to show my love for the people I care about most. I am 21 now, and I remembered your reply. I can&amp;#8217;t believe I never wrote back to thank you, it was so selfish of me to just take your valuable advice and not thank you in return! I just want you to know that someone far away in England is very grateful for your kind words. Since my original message I have lost two grandparents, and they were only in their 60s. One was in a car crash and the other one had a sudden heart attack. I now understand that life DOES go on although there is sometimes still the feeling that something wonderful is missing. I have also tried to console myself by looking forward to the future and thinking of the day when I have my own family. Thank you ever so much for your message in 2008 and I am truly sorry that I didn&amp;#8217;t thank you sooner. Rebekah P.S. I am now studying for a degree in Philosophy and I graduate next summer. Who knows what life will bring after that!

      Thank you! I&amp;#8217;ve asked my friends this question but I think that outside advice from someone who doesn&amp;#8217;t know any of us helped the most. I did choose Guy Number One, and I instantly knew that he was the right choice once we started to act more like a couple. 😀 Thanks again for your advice, I definitely will be coming back to this service if I need advice with anything ever again.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;hr /&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      Thank you very much for letting me realize that I&amp;#8217;m an okay person. I am sure that many other people appreciate your kindness and time you take to answer our question in our time of hardship. I hope that you can help a lot of other people who need help as much as I do. Thank you very much!

      Words can not express how touching this letter was to read. You are absolutely right I&amp;#8217;m going to apply! You words are a true blessing to my life and I thank you for taking the time to care.

      Dear Wise Old Owl, I wrote to you asking for help and advice, but you also gave me something else, you gave me courage. I have taken your advice, and have now been referred by my g.p, for counselling, and no words of mine can truly express how much thanks I owe you. Many kind regards,
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;hr /&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      Thank you very much, Helen, for helping me. Your response has given me pause for thought; much to consider in fact and although I may be wounded for a short while, I will not forget what you have written. Thanks once again.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;hr /&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      Thank you very much for your advice. It is very touching and I feel that you have listened to all I have written. Your advice is very wise. Thank you so much. My parents situation is more complicated as they share a business together however, as you said, this is for THEM to work out. I feel lighter having that reassurance and I can&amp;#8217;t tell you how much I just want to be a 26 year old and enjoy this beautiful time in my life without taking on my parents issues. What you have shared with me has made so much of sense and I will work hard at leaving their divorce to them. Thank you!
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;hr /&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      Thank you so much for the prompt response and a very thoughtful advice. I&amp;#8217;m grateful to Terry- Anne for sharing her life experience with us and showing us that there are choices we could make even when we find ourself helpless and heartbroken. It will be hard for us to cut the chord, but we must do so. Thank you so much for understanding our pain. God bless you.

      I would like to thank Grand-Jete for this very considered and thought-provoking response. It brings to life so many things I have thought about myself, yet been unable to put into words. I thank-you for your care, and it warms my heart to know that there are people in the world who will take the time to understand and help with another person&amp;#8217;s problems. I have a lot to think about, but thank you for helping me to channel my thoughts.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;hr /&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      This is more than what I ever expected. Reading this has been like talking to someone I&amp;#8217;ve known and trusted for a long time. I pray that I may remember your goodness and support you as life goes on. Thank you EWC.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      Wow! This helps a lot. I didn&amp;#8217;t really look at it from his perspective. But now I realize that I should have. This helps a lot, and I want to thank you! It opens up my mind A LOT( :

      Thank you SoCalJim; for your quick reply, for your kindess. Your response was well received. The timing of receipt was perfect and the support so desperately needed&amp;#8230;I had just gotten off the phone with my beloved and was crushed yet again by an inability to talk without fighting. In tears I sat down to think about things and to just&amp;#8230;well&amp;#8230;sit. Your email came in then. I will proceed with my counseling and make my prayers each day that all lessons will pass as quickly and painlessly as possible. Soon&amp;#8230;my eyes will see clearly what path I should take. Thanks again for all you do for the people who write&amp;#8230;when I&amp;#8217;m an elder&amp;#8230;I want to do the same. :o) What a rich exchange. Warmly and In Spirit,
    &lt;/p&gt;

      I have to say thank you for the words of wisdom. I&amp;#8217;m back on track and doing 100 % better than I was 3 months ago. You&amp;#8217;re an amazingly beautiful human being and I want to thank for saving my life. I&amp;#8217;ve never meet you or even heard your voice and yet out of all the people that has come in and out of my life, you were the person who got through to me. I thank you with all my heart and soul for the help and kind words. If there are actual angels and there is a heaven, you would be a guardian Angel for many people. There should be more people in this world like youself. I hope and wish all your great hopes and dreams come true for you and your family. 🙂

      Thank you Terry-Anne for your advice&amp;#8230;I needed to talk to someone neutral and you have been that person for me..I think you told me what I already knew but it helped immensely to hear it from a stranger. Again thank you for the great advice and just being there for me to talk to.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;hr /&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      Thank you, Texas-Grandpa, your advice makes a lot of sense&amp;#8230; I need to find ME again. I can honestly say that your response has given me a little more strength for this, and a feeling of reassurance. It is such a wonderful thing that all of you have established a website for people in need of advice, and I want you to know this because I would hate to see &amp;#8220;elderwisdom&amp;#8221; go away one day and not be around help all the others down the line. There is no way i can explain how much better i feel&amp;#8230;. maybe its cause I&amp;#8217;m from Texas too, don&amp;#8217;t know&amp;#8230;. but thanks.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;hr /&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      Once again thank you for your wise words &amp;#8211; I think I need time to reflect and think about the words you have written, but so appreciate the time and consideration you have taken, this alone gives me hope in my fellow man, Thank you,
    &lt;/p&gt;

      Dear Tom, Thank you so much for your letter! I know that the wisdom it contains hit home because by the time I was finished reading it, I was wiping away tears &amp;#8212; the good kind of tears. I will print out your letter and keep it in my nightstand, where I can read it whenever I&amp;#8217;m confused. On a side note&amp;#8230;my own beloved grandfather passed away thirteen years ago. It was wonderful to receive a letter from a &amp;#8220;cyber-grandfather.&amp;#8221; I think that my dear Gramps would heartily approve of this advice &amp;#8212; and I know he would be grateful to you for helping his granddaughter. Thank you again. I wish you and your wife every possible blessing.

    &lt;p&gt;
      Tthank you so much for your response. It was truly helpful to me, and I think I will try to make a list next time I find myself feeling anxiety about a situation. It&amp;#8217;s something I&amp;#8217;m trying to work on day by day, and I know that if I just learn to breathe and accept the fact that everyone can&amp;#8217;t like me all the time, but that the ones that like me for who I am are the ones to keep, I&amp;#8217;m sure I&amp;#8217;ll be able to gradually become more and more comfortable letting people into my life. Thanks, again! You&amp;#8217;re truly inspiring
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;hr /&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      Thank you. I read your response multiple times and cried, knowing that these are the exact words I need to hear. I cannot tell you how grateful I am for your wisdom.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      What a lovely, helpful letter which I will read, again and again. I am just waiting to hear of Mum&amp;#8217;s apt at the Hospital next week and then we can begin discussions. In the meantime, I am trying to pull myself together so that I am strong for both of them. Your expert help is much appreciated Gillian

      I have used this advice system a few times now, when I felt life was getting overwhelming and I couldn&amp;#8217;t turn to my own family for support. The older person in my family who I always went to for advice passed away almost 10 years ago. You guys have been great. I love being able to ask you questions about anything and never feel judged. Thank you for being honest and blunt. You have been like another family. Thank you
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;hr /&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      I will always keep this letter and the wonderful reply I received because it was my first step to getting the hell out of the situation I was in. I moved out with my children after contacting some local agencies as advised and altho&amp;#8217; some days are a struggle I&amp;#8217;m coping well and in a much better place than where I was when I sent this. So a HUGE thank you for the service and the lovely elder who replied .
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;hr /&gt;

      You are truly amazing! My sister told me about you and I am grateful to be able to share. My little angels! Thank you once again! Vanessa

      I would like to thank the gentleman who helped me understand better my marital situation. Although it&amp;#8217;s not easy or pleasant, his advice is really what I feel is correct, and I would like to thank him profoundly for being there, in the most difficult moments of my life. Thanking you. Llly

      Hi KayKay, I just wanted to say a heartfelt Thank You to you. You have showed me something that I was not able to understand or accept. In this last message, I just want to tell you how grateful I am for your help and what good you have done to me by giving me your elderly advice. Thank You, M
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      I wanted to thank you. About six months ago I emailed you about how depressed I was because I was over working myself. Now because of you and your advice, I feel a lot happier. You fixed my life. Thank you SO much.

      Dear Aunt Molly, Your comments on my advise request were so sincere, insightful, and helpful. I appreciate your time and &amp;#8220;elder wisdom&amp;#8221; so much.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;hr /&gt;

      Hi, I would like to give a great big THANK YOU to EWC member, Tell-Tom, for the thought provoking and informative response that was provided to my question. It gives me great insight on what I need to do, in addition to giving me a couple of options on which way I can go to get where I need to be. Thanks so much,
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;hr /&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      Hi again, I am very pleased with your response! It really was most useful and it has helped me generate some ideas of my own. I would love for me and my partner to get back together, I just don&amp;#8217;t want to put my life on hold while I wait for her. I will certainly try and keep myself busy and try and do new things to help bring some excitement back into my life. I would certainly recommend this service to friends if they ever needed it. I can&amp;#8217;t thank you enough!
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;hr /&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      Your advice has really helped me see the light, I had a long heart to heart with my boyfriend and I admit it was incredibly emotional. Your words have been very supportive and if I need advice again I&amp;#8217;ll definitely know who to go to. Thank you for your help. My counsellor told me that going to ElderWisdomCircle was the best idea I&amp;#8217;ve had in ages. I&amp;#8217;ll definitely write to you again xxxx
    &lt;/p&gt;

      Dear Helen I just wanted to say thank you for your advice. This has been a very painful week for me and I really wanted an outside opinion. This meant a great deal to me. I do know in my heart that this relationship wasn&amp;#8217;t right, in fact, I think deep down I knew it all along. Thank you once again, this site is really a great thing
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;hr /&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      Hello Ruth, I want to thank you for your advice. This site is very helpful! Speaking from someone who was VERY close to their grandmother your words are appreciated! I wish more people could get wind of this site. Alot of our problems today would be solved if we listened to our elders and the wisdom they have gained. My son has Autism, he is high functioning but I was thinking that may have something to do with his behavior. I will check into it. God bless you for what you are doing for other like myself who may not have that elder in their life to turn to. You are a blessing!!!! I will keep you in my prayers. Thank you,
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;hr /&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      Dear Hedwig Thank you very much for your advice and feedback. Something I will definitely take away from what you said is that when standing at the fork in the road, I should not focus on what I&amp;#8217;m losing but rather what I am gaining by making a choice in one direction. That is going to help me so much &amp;#8211; that simple truth. Thank you!
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;hr /&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      Thank you so much Elder Helen for finding the time, and making an effort, to take on a rather challenging question. I appreciate your feedback and I think you&amp;#8217;re right. Sharing your experiences with me is a reminder for me to believe in myself, trust my instincts, have faith in the grief process, and perhaps even see a day when I can reflect back and appreciate these life lessons. Wisdom is a gift. Thank you for sharing it. Please take care of yourself!
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;hr /&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      Thank you so much Elder Hedwig for your wise feedback. Others have offered essentially the same advice, so there&amp;#8217;s a consensus. So, I’m going to let it go and not sweat the small stuff. Thank you for reminding me of this important life lesson by sharing some of your experiences. I hope the best for you. Take care of yourself
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;hr /&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      Dear Frank, Thank you kindly for your words of advise and wisdom. The community service that you provide is valuable and it does make a difference in people&amp;#8217;s lives. We will continue our courtship and I won&amp;#8217;t be scared to give her a ring if this continue going this well. E.

    &lt;p&gt;
      Thank you very much. This information is very helpful and I am going to talk to my family and probably set up an intervention. I will definitely tell people about this program because it is helpful, free, and I didnt expect for you to reply so fast. Thanks
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;hr /&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      Dear KayKay, Thank you so much for your advice and volunteering your time. Your kind and wise words were refreshing and incredibly helpful. I needed to hear a voice of reason from someone who is not directly involved in this situation. I wish you the best. Thank you again, Sara
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;hr /&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      To all of you! I have more questions too! We do not give our elders enough voice in the world today. In many other countries an older person is respected to have much knowledge and advice. In our country getting older is not appreciated. Not listening to the voice of our peers is showing in our younger people. You guys rock!
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;hr /&gt;

      Dear Texas Grandpa: Thank you so much for your prompt response. You made me feel that I am on the right track and focusing on what is important in life to me. If I do happen to meet that special someone one day without looking fine, if not that&amp;#8217;s fine too. I truly appreciate your words of wisdom. Thank you sooo much!.

      Dear Gold-and-Wise, Thank you so much for your great advise! Your suggestions are greatly appreciated and I feel like there are many possibilities and options that I was overlooking. Thanks again for taking the time to help me! Sincerely,

      Thank you so much for your input. It is so nice to hear from someone objective and I appreciate the time you spent answering .I am more than happy with your answer and will be very likely use this forum again. Best Regards, Judy

      Thank you Ma&amp;#8217;am I appreciate your advice. As it turns out you were right but even if you were wrong I appreciate your taking the time to answer me 🙂

    &lt;hr /&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      Thank you Ron. I give you props on this, it&amp;#8217;s not easy to answer a question to someone&amp;#8217;s problem especially when you can&amp;#8217;t sit face to face with them and discuss it. I really appreciate you taking the time to answer my question. I often don&amp;#8217;t ask help from anyone and by doing that, it just sulks and eventually explodes. So thank you again! Have a wonderful year!
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;hr /&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      This email was exceptional help! From the moment I read it it helped me to get over him. We are still friends but I don&amp;#8217;t feel the same way I did before &amp;#8211; obsessing and contantly thinking about him. I needed to hear the truth. Thank you!
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;hr /&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      I thought maybe, possibly, with as many that come to you daily for advice or help, you might not have had time for me. Reading your letter put me to tears only because a part of me knew in my heart that would be the answer. I just needed to be sure. And I have lacked the courage to do so. It&amp;#8217;s just hard to face. I&amp;#8217;m still at this time with him and with your advice hopefully, before it goes any further or gets any harder I&amp;#8217;ll do the right thing the next oppertunity I get. Thank you so much for what you do. You took the time to respond to me personally and help. I will write you again telling you the decision I made and how I am, once I have made it. Knowing that there&amp;#8217;s someone out there who cares so much means the world and I don&amp;#8217;t feel so alone. I know what I need to do. I just want to thank you. God bless.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      Dear Grammy-Lin, Thank you for your thoughtful advice and quick response! I really appreciate your help and kind words 🙂 I am really glad I used ElderWisdomCircle.org because it helped me believe that there are people in the world that may not know who I am, but truly care and listen to me. In the future, when I am troubled and need someone to talk to, I will for sure send an email again! Thank you SO much!
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      Oh my goodness, thank you so much for your kind reply, Alexandra. This really meant a lot to me&amp;#8230;you have no idea. It made me feel like I might perhaps be a normal person experiencing normal things and not this crazy girl who feels too much. Have a great holiday season and maybe I&amp;#8217;ll write again when my life is interesting enough to be written about. ALL THE BEST!!
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;hr /&gt;

      I&amp;#8217;d just like to Reply with a Thank you. I honestly did not even expect a reply thinking your website is a hoax. I have read your message over and over and it really hit me with what I should do. Your website is a god-send. I will not look back on the memories between her and I. It wasn&amp;#8217;t worth it to give myself up to her.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;hr /&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      Thanks so much 🙂 this message made me feel soo good inside. I had a falling out with the guy &amp; we&amp;#8217;re not on speaking terms but I&amp;#8217;m happy knowing that I can get advice whenever I need it. Thanks Jacobus &lt;3

    &lt;p&gt;
      Sweet!!!!!!!!!!!! This is exactly what I was looking for, even the picture looks like it! I am so jazzed, thank you so much for your help. I read your advice letters alot, especially when I&amp;#8217;m down in the dumps. I&amp;#8217;ve been disabled and haven&amp;#8217;t been able to work or do much of anything for 3 yrs and then lost a son suddenly.

      Thank you so much. I really appreciate it. I found your site accidently on Google. But I believe it was meant to be.

      Thankyou for your response. You have helped me look at things in a different perspective. I think this is the best advice I have received out of everyone. I will love my son regardless. Thank you soo much for your time. It was a big help in my life right now

      Thank you for taking the time to respond to my letter. What you said makes a lot of sense and you seem to understand the situation. I am going to be mulling over this &amp; proceed cautiously. Your advice was very helpful. This is a great site. I am glad I found it.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      Dear SpiritSong, I wanted to thank you for the words of advice and encouragement that you gave me. I look forward to trying these tips that you gave me. I have more hope and excitement to try to understand others and myself. I can tell that you spoke from experience and the heart. Thank you, again, for taking the time to respond. Sincerely, Kimberly

      Thank you, Terry-Anne!! For you to take the time to write such a caring, heartfelt, detailed reply is amazing to me. Plus because you have been through the same experience as me (almost exactly!!) then I know that you meant every word &amp;#8211; it was wonderful advice. You have no idea how much I appreciate it. Thanks &amp;#8211; I will re-read and re-read your answer and definitely take your advice to heart.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;hr /&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      Thank you very much for taking the time to answer and think about my questions. I appreciated your response and am thankful for the advice! I hope you are continually blessed through elderwisdomecircle. Thanks, have a great weekend! Matthew

      Dear Terry-Ann, Our heart-felt thanks for your response. Your advice really hit home with me and validates what we think we need to do, but has not yet done. It is clear your advice comes from someone who loves her sons and has practiced what is really hard in parenting. We are grateful for you sharing your wisdom with us in our time of great turmoil and need. God bless you.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      Purple-Finch, I just want to thank you, from the bottom of my heart, for all of your advice. I never could have asked for more. I have decided, with your help, to break any and all communication until we can see each other face to face again. My hope is that we can figure things out once we both have had a chance to clear our minds I hope you can appreciate exactly how much your kind words have helped me through this. When I say I have no one to talk to about this I mean it. I have not talked to a soul about this, except you. I know you suggested talking to a therapist, and I thought about that too, but I just don&amp;#8217;t have it in me. Maybe One day I will learn to swallow my pride, but not today. Thank you for your wisdom, your understanding, and your insight. I won&amp;#8217;t forget this. You have my utmost respect and undying gratitude. Sincerely, Robert
    &lt;/p&gt;

      I wanted to thank you very much for this. Its nice to know I&amp;#8217;m not the only one and that its not ME that just has to completely change my ways, do you have any idea how many times I&amp;#8217;ve heard something about how i have to come completely out of my shell and that no one will notice me if I dont put myself out there. My thought has always been that, if I&amp;#8217;m not that type of person, why would I want someone who didnt notice me for the real me? Anyway, thanks again, you really did help me out.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      Hello Grammy-Lin, Thank you for your wise words. It provided some comfort to know that someone understands. I have put a lot of thought into what you said about counseling and I think I&amp;#8217;m going to start talking to someone. Your comments made a lot of sense and I don&amp;#8217;t want to end up losing my boyfriend and being unhappy without at least trying to fix it. Thank you again. Kind regards,
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;hr /&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      To BARBARA at the EWC: I really liked what you had to say and how, basically you helped me give myself permission to have these real feelings and not keep playing into the role I&amp;#8217;ve been assigned in the family. Just being able to hear someone say that you are not crazy and validate my emotions and anger and confusion, she gave me great comfort and being that i don&amp;#8217;t know her it is amazing how well this site enables people like me to say things with the veil of secrecy, anonymity, that frees me up to think about what is bugging me without having to worry if it will go farther with gossip or with a person not being honest about keeping their word to you and then going around blabbing to everyone. So, A huge THANK YOU to BARBRA and everyone there at EWC. You ROCK!
    &lt;/p&gt;

      Thank you to Terry-Anne for being so compassionate and informative and for making me feel heard during a desperate time. My husband and I are both scheduled for a Dr.&amp;#8217;s appt. and are approaching Thanksgiving with a whole new frame of mind. At least we were given a direction to head in and she shared some feelings of her own. She mentioned starting a gratitude journal and I have done that and it helps to put my feeling somewhere instead of letting them bounce around on their own to find nooks and crannies of sadness, pockets of emptiness or puddles of self-pity. These are not things I want to cultivate in any way and just being able to ask some stranger annonymously&amp;#8230;on a whim, well what I thought was a whim but now see as a spiritual nudge, a whisper, in the right direction which the universe provided and God. Thank you so much for being THERE wisdom circle and Terry-Anne, you really helped a couple of desperate people who were flopping around like fish out of water. We are doing better and are seeing a light at the end of the tunnel and heading for it&amp;#8230;PHEW. Bless you all.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      Dear Baer, Just wanted to thank you and let you know how much I appreciate your timely and encouraging advice. You touched on some very key issues here like my belief that &amp;#8220;I can&amp;#8217;t do it&amp;#8221;. I also liked what you said about taking on an attitude that I am &amp;#8220;in control of my life&amp;#8221; and not &amp;#8220;at the effect of it&amp;#8221; I know that it&amp;#8217;s going to take some hard effort to begin again and change my thinking patterns but what have I got to lose, right? I&amp;#8217;m pretty sure I&amp;#8217;ll be reading your advice to me over and over again. So thanks again for doing what you do. sincerely,
    &lt;/p&gt;

      Dear Elder Thank you very much for the comfort, advice and support . I&amp;#8217;m moving on, life has so much better to offer. Take care ! Love Crystal

    &lt;p&gt;
      Thank you so much for your advice! I even shared this email with a friend of mine. I asked for her advice (and it was good), but after I read her what you wrote, she said wow and her eyes opened big. She said how deep you went with the dishonesty part and agreed. Your advice truly is wise. I am highly grateful for you! Thank you! I love your forwardness and being transparent and so loving! Be blessed! Im sure I will need you again.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;hr /&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      Thank you for your considerate and kind reply. I feel well understood and supported by your answer &amp;#8212; and the fact that it comes from a place of empathy and compassion makes the advice so much stronger. I am very grateful, and will carefully consider everything you said.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;hr /&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      Hello Alexandra, Thank you for the very insightful and experienced reply. I will do my best to be strong and supportive for her! Thank you again,
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;hr /&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      Thanks for the advice. Luckily I have been fairly quiet concerning my opinion and now I can see how that will serve my own peace of mind. I appreciate the thoughtfulness of your reply and depth of understanding the situation. Blessings, Sandra A.

      Dear Hedwig, Thanks for your affirming and encouraging emails. I have confidence that I will find those pineapples at some point, and in the meantime I&amp;#8217;m just trying to do the next right thing. It&amp;#8217;s good to have a reminder that there&amp;#8217;s a world beyond the one I&amp;#8217;m (for now). I just have to remember that the dark places are temporary, Your being there through Elder Wisdom Circle is a real life-saver. I hope I have the privilege of passing on some of the support you&amp;#8217;ve given me to someone else one day. Alll best wishes&amp;#8211; Danielle

      Hello Ruth! This reply is very helpful &amp; so quick! Thank you very much. I did in fact call and say we would love to have some news of them and my son replied today! It was lovely. However, he didn&amp;#8217;t offer to come over. I&amp;#8217;m thinking about the &amp;#8216;meal out&amp;#8217; as my husband will probably manage it. Anyway, I really appreciate your advice; you are very wise, Best wishes, Carole.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      Dear Aunt-Molly, Thank you so much for such a quick and thorough reply! You&amp;#8217;re right&amp;#8211; a gift giving class would have been a good idea in high school! I&amp;#8217;ve decided to take your advice on the matter, and to make sure I spend the money on something practical and useful for my kids. In this case, a snow suit for my older son, and I think I will start a savings account with the rest for my younger son (he&amp;#8217;s 7 months old). And, I will make sure I send a great thank you note with a picture of my son in his snow suit. Thanks again for your thoughtful reply. I sure wish the EWC had been around when I was a teenager! I only found out about it a few months ago, and think it&amp;#8217;s such a wonderful idea. Thanks to all you who take the time to offer us your pearls of wisdom. 🙂 Best Regards,
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;hr /&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      Thank you so much! Wow! You are very wise, I agree with everything you said. I hope things will be okay and I pray that God will keep us strong. We do not see each other often and he respects me very much, this is what amazes me about him. We really hope to have a second chance in the future. You have no idea how much better I am feeling now. You are awesome! Thank you again for replying to my email. Thank you, thank you!
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;hr /&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      Dear Aunt Molly, I cannot thank you enough for your beautifully wise reply. In reading, my thoughts were provoked in terms of looking at things from the heart instead of the anger and annoyance I felt. I can now see what really matters, and yes, certainly my husband is able to show me his love in so many other ways and has never displayed the selfish atitude I thought I saw from this occasion. The answer is yes I do feel cherished by him in so many many many ways and it was in fact selfish of me to treat my gift giving as a &amp;#8216;swap&amp;#8217;. I did it because I love him and will do the same next year! Thank you so much once again.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;hr /&gt;

      Hi Larry, Your advice really moved me to tears. More than you know your words made a difference in my life. Thank you so much! God bless you!
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;hr /&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      Dear Aunt Molly, Many thanks for your astute and concise ideas below. I think you&amp;#8217;re 100% right, that I have given too much emotional power to my ex-husband. I need to move beyond caring what he thinks. As long as I act in accordance with my own (high) standards, that&amp;#8217;s all I can do. I think I was beating myself up too much about this and trying to be the best and most blameless ex-wife I could be, when all I really need to be is the best PERSON I can be and not be so hard on myself in the ex-wife category. Many thanks, many thanks for opening my eyes to this! It was really and truly helpful. Thank you! Best wishe to you and the other good folks at EWC . . .
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;hr /&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      Thank you so much for your advice and for sharing your early marriage experience!! I was so afraid to open the e-mail, but now I&amp;#8217;m so glad I did. I wrote my entry when I was feeling very depressed about the situation, and then I was scared that it made me sound crazy. But thank you so much for being so kind and understanding! I&amp;#8217;m still thinking everything through, but I even just feel better about everything, after sharing it with someone. God bless you!
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      Alexandra, Thank you for the advice, and for nudging me in the right direction. I guess I just needed an unbiased, wise opinion to see things straight. I don&amp;#8217;t know how I&amp;#8217;m going to tell her, but it was a fleeting fling that wasn&amp;#8217;t meant to last. All I can hope is that she gets back up on her feet after this and doesn&amp;#8217;t regret the time wasted. Thank you,
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;hr /&gt;

      Dear DeeBee, Thanks for the advice about my crush. It was the best advice from Elder Wisdom I&amp;#8217;ve ever gotten. Just thought I&amp;#8217;d let you know that my crush is now my boyfriend :). Just saying your advice influenced that, and that&amp;#8217;s a good thing. Thanks!

      Dear Elders I am writing this from the city in Germany. And I wish to thank you from the bottom of my heart, specially for this very important line : &amp;#8216; It’s too early to start thinking about backup plans.&amp;#8217; If you only knew how just telling me that took a load of my little, overthinking, microplanning shoulders. All the best to you all.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      Dear Ms. SuzannaRoseanna,Thank you very much for your well thought out response to my questions. It really helped me put a lot of things in perspective, especially as I have been doing a lot of reflecting lately. I will definitely be looking into the books you suggested for further guidance. Thank you for your help and insight.

      My message is for Grammy-Lin who made me feel like someone wrapped a warm blanket around my soul and not only listen but shared and gave thoughtful and insightful answers. I really was more than I ever expected in it&amp;#8217;s powerful statement about &amp;#8220;changing the channel&amp;#8221; and being the master of your own thoughts. I thought I was doing that to some degree but felt at a loss when triggered sometimes. I can&amp;#8217;t stand falling into that pity party, woe is me yuckiness. The thing is she really touched a place that is in (I believe) my cellular memory, bloodline&amp;#8230; because I am 1/2 Japanese and use my meditation daily and my Father is a master of mind over matter (he is the Japanese half&amp;#8230;Mom is Swedish)&amp;#8230;I tell people that at our wedding , half the family was throwing rice and half was catching it!..little joke, anyways&amp;#8230;she is RIGHT! I thank her for &amp;#8220;reminding&amp;#8221; me to use what I already have and extend it to my painful thoughts, or bubbles&amp;#8230;and just the fact that I got it off my chest and somebody cared enough to send me such good useful info make my heart sing. My blessings and good intentions to Grammy-Lin and all of you for being such a helpful and, I think, spiritual connection over this Internet madness. You are all wonderful for your capacity to care for complete strangers&amp;#8230;love to all Sincerely,
    &lt;/p&gt;

      Hi Alexandra, Thank you so much for your reply. I really needed to share my feelings with someone and for that person to be a neutral party. I wanted to let you know that I really appreciate your answer and the help/advice you have given me. Before writing my letter to you, I felt alone and lost. Part of me was trying to figure this out logically and part of me was not. Reading your response has helped me understand what I was feeling and why.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;hr /&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      I wanted to thank you SO MUCH for your wonderful advice Tom. I shared this correspondence with Ed, and I believe this has given him hope. Its one thing for the love of his life to hear and understand him- I&amp;#8217;ll back him up on anything. But for a source that does not know us to say these things makes all the difference. Ed will seek counselling immediately, and we thank you so much for your time and consideration. Take Care!!
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;hr /&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      Thank you soooo much! I understand and you are correct in what you said, thank you so very much!!!! 🙂

    &lt;hr /&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      Loved this advice. Loved it. Thank you for being very specific. I am learning about myself again and I surely don&amp;#8217;t want to be in a wrong state of mind when a good man comes along so I need to be patient.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;hr /&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      Wow! Thank you BG for your very thorough response. Its obvious you really took your time and thought about how to reply, I dont even get that kind of attention from my own family, LOL. You covered everything. I have always wanted to be an xray tech, and learn MRI and then if I had time later take another year for Nuclear Medicine. But it always just seemed a little out of my reach. Thank you for helping me realize that it isnt and for validating my thoughts, and for your great advice!
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;hr /&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      Thank you so much! Your advice came at a perfect time! This helped a lot and you suggested some things that I never would have thought of! I really didn&amp;#8217;t know who to talk to about this because some people who know him don&amp;#8217;t want to help and I couldn&amp;#8217;t tell anyone who was that close to him without running the risk of him finding out too much.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;hr /&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      Thank you so much!! This was very helpful 🙂 Exactly what I was looking for
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;hr /&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      Thank you very much for this solid piece of guidance. It&amp;#8217;s exactly what I needed, and what would have been hard to find elsewhere. I&amp;#8217;m still quite upset, but this helped me more than I thought it could have. Thank you so much: you and everyone else at Elder Wisdom Care are doing wonderful things. 🙂
    &lt;/p&gt;

      It has taken me a while to get around to writing this, but I did mean to for a long time. Michelle wrote a lovely email for me, and everytime I have had a hard few days I have re-read her response and it gave me a little hope. It&amp;#8217;s answered everything in such a sensitive, wise and logical way. I&amp;#8217;m extremely grateful to her, she is really someone to keep! Thank you so much!
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;hr /&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;#8230;I would like to say a HUGE thank you for your wisdom and kindness and wonderful advice and ideas. I am following them up as soon as this leaves my computer. You deserve many blessings for giving your time especially as you obviously have your own family problems to deal with. Thank you &amp;#8211; I think you are an angel, sort of in disguise.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;hr /&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      Thank you so very much. Your advice on the situation has definitely helped me to see things from a less biased perspective and clear my head a bit. Thank you so much for taking the time not only to read and reply to my question, but to reply so thouroughly and thoughtfully. It helps, so much. Much more than I initially expected. The world can&amp;#8217;t ever have enough people like you, and the other Elders. (: Sincerely, Jessica

      WOW, thank you dearly for your response! I am so greatful! I was ready to give up at this point with my situation. I think you are right, my marriage deserves a chance to survive though&amp;#8230;.atleast for our kids. Things have been so great up until this! We will absolutely seek counceling and he is willing, we are starting a new church on sunday as well. I think you are right about my friend&amp;#8230;.its unreal the lies that she has told and will still tell me when I have absolute proof in black in white in my face! I guess deep down I know I will really never know the whole truth but my marriage deserves another chance and I want to give it that. Thank you so much for your response&amp;#8230;.you are so helpful!!!! I never imagined when I first went to your site that you would give such great advice&amp;#8230;I will defintely visit again! thank you again.

      Thank you so much Aunt Molly for your comforting letter. You make such good points, and I&amp;#8217;ll try to remember them as I deal with this. Thanks for reminding me too that I shouldn&amp;#8217;t expect everything I say to &amp;#8220;take hold&amp;#8221; right away but that the process is necessary.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;hr /&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      Thank you for the advice I was given. I am not with my boyfriend anymore. The advice helped. Thank you. I would use this website again. I can&amp;#8217;t thank you enough nor tell you how much it did actually help me : ). Thank you Kenti.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      Thank you so much for your advice! I just got back from the beach (I went alone, without him!) and it was great to get away and be by myself. Upon coming back we had a talk and are officially now broken up. He is now actively trying to &amp;#8220;win me back&amp;#8221; and is being extra kind etc but I&amp;#8217;m standing strong, and we&amp;#8217;ll see how long the extra kindness lasts anyway&amp;#8230; Everything you said was very insightful &amp;#8211; some were things that came across my mind before, but I quickly denied them but I guess I was just denying the truth. Thanks again so much for you help and volunteering your time to be part of the elder wisdom circle. Every person whom you converse with is lucky to get your insight!

      Thank you, thank you so very much for your advice. Between the time I first sent this query and receiving a reply, I had made the decision to do what I wanted, whether for good or bad. Thus far, things seem to be turning out just fine. I suppose I should have listened to my own advice a long time ago, but upon reading yours it really showed me that ultimately everything is my own decision and no one else&amp;#8217;s.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      Dear Aunt-Molly and the Elder Wisdom Circle, I wanted to thank you so much for your response to my question. I am not sure what kind of reply I was expecting in return, but I do know that what I received exceeded all of the expectations that I could have had. I was delighted by the advice that was given to me. As Aunt-Molly stated in her reply, I really already knew the answers to my questions. I guess I was unknowingly seeking out someone to validate what I was feeling. Aunt-Molly not only supplied that, she gave me some wonderful gems of wisdom that I am going to save for future reference&amp;#8230;things that I can apply to so many areas of my life. Thank you again. What a wonderful, wonderful service!!! April

      Thank you SO MUCH. Thats the best advice I think I&amp;#8217;ve ever gotten. I never even thought about linking &amp;#8220;living in the moment&amp;#8221; and my goals in one. I also never thought about how I&amp;#8217;m not living to the fullest now, I&amp;#8217;m waiting for it&amp;#8230; and it wont come unless I do something. I didn&amp;#8217;t see that about myself until you told me. This is the greatet website ever! I&amp;#8217;m going to recommend it. =] Thank you
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;hr /&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      Thank you so much, once again. When I get really sad i look back at your advice and it helps me realize what i can do to help myself. I&amp;#8217;ll be trying my hardest to work through this, and talking to you helped. Thank you.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      Dear Elder Wisdom Circle: Thank you for the straight talk that opened my eyes to the simplest of solutions. As a result I am happily washing the dishes for my Dad every chance I get, which is almost always these days. Also, I am extremely grateful for your collection of &amp;#8220;water shortage&amp;#8221; information. This is exactly what I was also hoping for in your response to me, a convenient bundle of germane news on this topic to help me share with my Dad (and others along the way). I&amp;#8217;m making a donation via your link immediately to you for your invaluable, helpful words of wisdom and guidance. Furthermore, I shall be heralding your good work to everyone I know! Best regards, Andrew
    &lt;/p&gt;

      I justed wanted to say thank you very much, your advice was very reassuring, and I really needed it =). I hope to keep working on composing while I&amp;#8217;m at Tech and learning about computers. If I ever have any other problems, I know exactly who I&amp;#8217;m going to. Thanks again! Alan

      Thank you, thank you, thank you so much for your reply Jangela, which is so insightful and comforting, and to the creators of this awesome website. I&amp;#8217;ll be sharing it with many, many people and will be returning for more great advice. I simply cannot say thank you enough. I come from a broken home and I was not raised around elders to offer guidance. This website fills a huge need in my life. It also makes me more respectful and unafraid of aging. Thanks again. Best,
    &lt;/p&gt;

      Thank you so much for your reply and your caringness! You have no idea how much your reply helped me! When i grow up I want to be apart of things just like this because they are amazing and help people so much that are in need! It answered my question completely so thanks so much again! if i&amp;#8217;m ever able to donate I will! and will definately refer others to this site when i can&amp;#8217;t answer their questions! God Bless! Thanks Again Sincerely,

      I am currently a 19-year-old male going into my third year of college. I just want to say that I used Elder Wisdom Circle a few years in high school. It helped me to get my first girlfriend and become friends with a kid with whom I had NOTHING in common. I recently requested some advice on a very important problem of mine and I am so excited to receive a response because I just know that it will help regardless of the responder. Thank you for your support and essentially redirecting me away from difficult paths in my life. You have no idea how appreciative I am of your group.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      Hello! Sorry I took so long to reply, but I am so happy to inform you that my mother recently sought some fantastic help from the new psychologist and psychiatrist and she has been so very much better. She&amp;#8217;s come back to being a normal, loving, caring mother. That mother I remembered years ago that used to pack my school lunch everyday. I&amp;#8217;d like to thank you so much for your support. There were times when I thought I couldn&amp;#8217;t bare not having a proper mother figure, but now she is so much better. We hold the best conversations as mother and daughter and this feeling I have in my stomach when writing this email is beyond happy. Thanks again. I wish I could give you a massive hug!
    &lt;/p&gt;

      Dear Helen, Thank you for your kind words, and helpful advice. I am so very glad that elderwisdomecircle is available for individuals like myself that do not have family or supportive environment! Helen, I hope to write again, for now I shall heed your words until I need a gentle ear to turn to. Thank you, Margaret
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      Thank you so much. I really do feel better and I will always keep these thoughts with me. You guys are very helpful and I&amp;#8217;m very apppreciative. I&amp;#8217;m glad I have someone to talk to who willl give me advice because I cant really talk to my parents. I&amp;#8217;m glad I found this website.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;hr /&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      Thank you so much! I&amp;#8217;ll show my parents my letter and your reply as soon as I can, and I&amp;#8217;ll let you know what happens after that. It really helped hearing your advice! I&amp;#8217;ll keep in touch
    &lt;/p&gt;

      Please thank Terry-Anne for her comforting advice. It&amp;#8217;s just what I need during this exciting, but scary time in my life. Her words just reaffirmed what I feel in my heart. Hearing this from wonderful people with wisdom and life experience helps me not be so afraid. Thank you
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;hr /&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      Terry-Anne, Thank you Thank You! Your sincerity and understanding of this situation is tremendous. I have tears in my eyes. You have totally understood and given me the best advice I know in my heart I must step away and live my life. I will forgive and move on. Bless you,
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;hr /&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      Wow! Thank you so much. This helped me a lot! I appreciate the time you gave to answer my question. I think I&amp;#8217;m heading in the right direction now!
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;hr /&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      Dear Terry-Anne, Thank you so much for your quick response to my letter. Your advice has greatly helped me in my situation. What a blessing to have a response from someone that experienced the same thing I am going through. I thank you so much for taking the time to share your experience and to give me the advice and insight into this matter. Thank you for the idea of keeping a journal, I did feel a little lighter after putting it all down in my letter to Elder Wisdom. I will use your excellent advice to get me through this time in my life. Thank you so much,
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;hr /&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      This is the best website I&amp;#8217;ve ever come across! Thank you so much for your wise words!
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;hr /&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      I am so appreciative of this insightful and kind reply from Terry-Anne. It actually touches on many aspects of the situation that I have considered in recent weeks, particularly God&amp;#8217;s love as the strongest support we could ever know. What helps alot is your message that worrying about the future may take away from what we need to be focussing on today. And that your life may have been easier, but not better, if your son was not disabled. Thank you for helping me understand and be more aware of what our children might need, and not need, during this trying time. I have to wonder how the Elder Wisdom Circle found the perfect person to give me some answers. Jayne

      Dear Hedwig: Thank you for your quick and kind response. I felt so much better being able to &amp;#8220;talk&amp;#8221; to someone about this and &amp;#8220;hear&amp;#8221; what you had to say. I take comfort in you telling me that each stage we go through is different and special, but since my mom died &amp;#8211; change &amp;#8211; has overwhelmed me with fear and sadness. That has been my stumbling block. My daughter is wonderful and I think we will be or at least I hope we will be close, like you and your mother. You have helped me tremendously. I just have to make myself be okay with change. I&amp;#8217;ve read your email about 5 times now to help me get the courage to face the change that the future has and realize that it isn&amp;#8217;t necessarily a bad thing. I never thought of the fact that I am also maturing. We can do this together &amp;#8211; you are right. Thanks again for everything. Have a wonderful day! Sincerely,
    &lt;/p&gt;

      Hello Texas-Grandpa Thank you so much, it did help a great deal. I am going to seek someone to talk to, but getting this email helped me so much, and has given me clarity to see what my personal feelings could not let me see. Again thank you so much for your advice and for caring enough to provide this service, it means everything to know there is always somewhere that you can turn to. Kind Regards
    &lt;/p&gt;

      Dear Jay63, Thankyou so much for your advice . It is really helping me with some tough decisions. It was also great to tell someone and know that someone cares and that i&amp;#8217;m not alone in this . Thankyou again bless you
    &lt;/p&gt;

      YOU MADE ME CRY. BUT A GOOD CRY. TEARS CLEANSE THE SOUL. YOU ARE AN ANGEL IN HUMAN CLOTHING.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;hr /&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      I would first like to begin by saying thank you for taking the time to answer my question. The response that I received was more than just helpful; the words are so true. Your honesty and obvious wisdom about life reminds one of what we can control and what we cannot&amp;#8230;and learning to understand the difference between the two. A willingness to just let some things be. Your words,simple but so true, have made a greater impact on me more than any other help I&amp;#8217;ve sought. Thank you so very much. I will put to practice some of the things you mentioned&amp;#8230;.communication with him, inventory on me, and appreciating what we do share. Thank you.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      Pickles Marie- Thank you so much for the amazing advice! &amp;#8220;Mr. Right&amp;#8221; and I have since ended our relationship since he wasn&amp;#8217;t sure if he saw himself marrying me (and to be honest, I think I feel the same way), but I&amp;#8217;m optimistic about my future now and meeting the person I am supposed to be with. Thank you and again and I&amp;#8217;m thrilled I found the Elder&amp;#8217;s Wisdom Circle
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;hr /&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      Thank you for the reply. I can tell a lot of thought and consideration went into my problem. My first inclination was to not go to the wedding and stand by my son, but the sadness of the whole situation cast doubt in my mind. Your input will help strengthen me to do what is right for me and my son. Everyone else will have to live with the choices they have made. God bless you all. The Elder Wisdom Circle has been there for me before and I appreciate the fact that I have a caring circle of &amp;#8220;friends&amp;#8221; to gravitate towards in times of need.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;hr /&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      Dear Terry-Anne, Thank you for taking the time to reply to my questions. I did not realize this would actually be a legal matter but, after reading your reply, I see it is indeed so I will consult with someone who can help me draw up an agreement.Thank you for sharing your wisdom in this matter.Sincerely, Sandy
    &lt;/p&gt;

      Thank You Teresa For Your Help. I Decided Not To Do It. And I Told Him This.. So He Broke Up With Me. He Tried To Lead Me Into Having It But I Said No, And It Was Hard With All The Pressure Cause I Give Into Pressure Very Easily, Thank You For Helping Me, And I Dont Think I Would Of Been Able To Say No Without Your Advice, I Greatly Appreciate It. I Will Find Someone Who Respects Me. For Me, And My Needs And Things I Do Not Want To Do. Thanks Again,
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      Thank you so, so much. I&amp;#8217;m just in tears, so grateful for this wise reply. I think you&amp;#8217;re right. He called me this morning. We agreed we have work to do. I did ask him if he would go to counseling &amp;#8211; before I even got this &amp;#8211; and he said yes. Your reply confirmed what I was thinking and went so much further. He means so much to me, and I thank you from the bottom of my heart. I will keep you posted! Thank you for your kindess, your wisdom, and your generosity in sharing what you know.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;hr /&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      I&amp;#8217;m amazed at how comprehensive and insightful the advice was. I can&amp;#8217;t thank you enough.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;hr /&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      Dear Terry-Anne, What a thoughtful response. Thank you and I appreciate the time and thoroughness you took with it. And I&amp;#8217;m just a stranger!
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;hr /&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      Elder Teresa, Thank you so much for your very prompt reply! It was a very gratifying read. You gave me good food for thought. I can sense the effort you put into your reply. For several years, my husband has told me I should be charging a fee for my time with these people I descibed below. I have gotten the book you recommended, The Work, from my local public library, and have just begun reading it. I hope will make me think, perhaps, along different pathways than my usual rut. I find myself wishing I had you for my own personal friend! In cyberspace, it&amp;#8217;s almost like having a spirit-guide! I find myself almost wanting to ask you more and more questions &amp;#8211; but I won&amp;#8217;t do that. Don&amp;#8217;t want to wear out my welcome. Your parting words of wisdom I have recorded in my book of Nuggets of Wisdom. Oh yes, I write, and collect wise or beautiful quotes. I&amp;#8217;m going to hold onto it. warm thanks
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;hr /&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      Thanks for responding. I am so glad that I discovered your website for giving advice. I feel much better getting a second opinion. I wish you the best!!! Thanks so much for responding!!! I really needed a second opinion and thanks for validating my feelings!!!
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;hr /&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      What a wonderful service. Thanks for the advice. I&amp;#8217;ll take it to heart and talk directly with my brother. I think it&amp;#8217;s good to sometimes get advice from an unbiased perspective. My other brothers and sisters are too close to the situation and personal feelings can skew the logical course of action. Take care,
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;hr /&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      Thanks very much. That was some of the best advice I have ever received. I appreciate it very much.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      Hi, I just want to thanks for the advice I don&amp;#8217;t have family with me in United States and I was in need for someone to open my eyes. Thank you so much, this confirms I was not wrong. I will definitely do something about it. thanks again!
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;hr /&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      Thank you so much! When one is inside of an issue it is so hard to come up with a good compromise like the one you suggested below. thank you again. I will definetly talk to my husband and see if we can arrange a family meeting and suggest that. I really sounded as if a real person answered my question and not a automated response like some websites. Thank you again. Your advise is greatly appreciated!
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;hr /&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      Thank you so much! Aunt Molly:)..I will keep in mind your golden advice always. Following your advice things have already changed between us. I am very happy now. I really appreciate your replying to my problem. Thank you from the bottom of my heart. Cheers
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;hr /&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      Dear Hedwig, Your response helped me tremendously! Thank you very much, I actually started crying when I read it partly because now I know the answer and partly because I realized I was not being understanding and supportive, just angry and hurt. Thank you very, very much!
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;hr /&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      I thank you for making me understand. It is really hard being friends but I am sure it will all work out in the long run. After all everything in life happens for a reason and it is always for our best. I keep telling myself that and it really helps. You have been so kind and understanding and I really appreciate all the help and words of wisdom. Thank you again
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;hr /&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      Bobbi Jo, Thank you so much for your advise&amp;#8230; I really needed to hear it worded that way. I love my best friend and I love my god son&amp;#8230; I don&amp;#8217;t want to hurt them! The love I have for them is more important then I the love think I have for my ex! Thank you so much for snapping me back into reality!
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;hr /&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      Dear Aondreaa, I would just like to thank you so much for your advice. Many of the points you raise are things I had thought of, but was unsure of whether I was reading things correctly. Your reply has helped clarify this for me. Your advice to me is greatly appreciated. Kind Regards
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;hr /&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      Dear Elder, Thank you, sometimes you need a friend who can understand what I might be going through. It’s very comforting to know, I have someone to ask for advice at Elder Wisdom. This is my first time visiting your site and I am very pleased, I will tell all my friends. God bless you.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;hr /&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      Outstanding! So much better to get advice from someone on the outside looking in. Thanks so much. You make lots of sense. Why should I make any decision. If it comes to that then I will cross that bridge when I get there. Things so often fall into place as they were meant to be. Thanks for all your help. You are certainly wise. Not so confused in Miami&amp;#8230;.:-)
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;hr /&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      Dear Texas-Grandpa, Thank you so much for your kind and honest reply. You are absolutely correct about the trust issues and right that I should end the marriage anyway, separate from my feelings for the other person. Your advice has been so helpful and I hope that I have the courage to end my marriage. I know you are right about taking time out for me and I will do that if I end the marriage. It is a hard thing to do, my marriage is comfortable and my husband is my friend but there are also serious problems. Thanks so much for your honesty and kindness you have no idea how helpful it has been to be able to talk this out and hear your advice.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;hr /&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      As I read this reply I am speechless. I hardly scratched the surface in my email and your reply convinced me that you could read between the lines. I completely agree with this response and need to figure out why I can&amp;#8217;t let go. Time is wasting and I have so much love and kindness to give to someone. Perhaps the fact that my father passed away when I was 5 has contributed to my downfall. I remember waiting by the front door for him to return even after I was told he had gone to heaven. I thought if I had been &amp;#8220;better&amp;#8221; he would have come back to me. Such is the simplicity of a child. Thank you so much for such a thoughtful response. Perhaps you saved a life today, certainly a soul. Michele
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      I would like to say, thank you for giving me a direction. I was so lost in this mess of problems that I didn&amp;#8217;t bother to think of a way out of it. I know that only I can fix myself but I didn&amp;#8217;t know how or if i should in the first place. I will keep this as a checklist to improve myself and put some of these ideas into action. I now realize that I have to keep looking forward and that this is just the beginning. If these aren&amp;#8217;t my true friends then I&amp;#8217;ll use the experience to learn how to socialize. I have to keep my head up and not let my negative thoughts slow me down. I would like to thank you again for your help.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;hr /&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      Thank you so much for your advice. I was very confused but your advice has helped me tremendously. You were 100% percent correct on all you said. What you do is great. I really appreciate the help you give me and many others.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;hr /&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      Dear Annie, I really can&amp;#8217;t thank you enough&amp;#8230;I can&amp;#8217;t believe how much you wrote and how much better I&amp;#8217;ve been feeling. I&amp;#8217;m sorry I can&amp;#8217;t write very much back, I&amp;#8217;m very busy with school/scholarship work. I just wanted to say thank you so much for your time and effort.. I won&amp;#8217;t forget this letter. Sincerely, Will
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;hr /&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      Thank you very much for your advice, I not only found it very settling but helped me to curb my paranoia (admittedly). I actually at the end of your letter had a little chuckle to myself for being such a droll guy. You have seemed to hit the nail on the head and I will be heeding your advice. &amp;#8220;.. but you will preserve the peace best by playing deaf as long as you can.&amp;#8221; Thank you again to help put my mind at ease, and my peace, love and joy be with you Aunt-Bella and all the Elders. ~Mark P.S. EWC is a fantastic web site, its great that people care enough to help others by offering an un-biased &amp;#8220;3rd party&amp;#8221; point of view and advice. I honestly felt my issue would be considered trivial (although to me it was not).
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      Thank you so much for your suggestions. You made me feel so much better and now I feel like I have a starting place. I think that was the hardest part, figuring out how to begin. All of this can be overwhelming. Thank you so much for your help. You have such a nice way about you that I found your email both very constructive and consoling. Take good care.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;hr /&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      It seems to me that the Elders at EWC are ANGELS from heaven above trying to alleviate the pain that folks like me go through in this world.

      Hello. My deepest thanks for the elders&amp;#8217; words of wisdom during this particularly confusing time. With the help of a very strong community of friends we have set our addict friend up with a safe environment and with resources to help with her recovery. I am happy to report that she is now nearly three weeks clean. I understand that the recividism rate for heroin is very high and that we may not have magically &amp;#8216;cured&amp;#8217; her, but I feel that we did the best we could and we gave her a strong head start for her physical detoxification. The rest is really up to her. Your advice of using a &amp;#8216;tough love&amp;#8217; approach (warn that our friendship will be dissolved if the drug use continues) was extremely hard to swallow, but brought the right amount of gravity to conversations with my friend and also helped me to establish and maintain healthy boundaries for myself. Thank you for your insight, your wisdom, and taking the time to compassionately answer a stranger&amp;#8217;s question.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;hr /&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      Excellent advice! Of which I am following TO THE LETTER. Because you are absolutely right &amp;#8211; in every way. Your reply has helped me understand this situation on a completely different level &amp;#8211; and now I see! Thank you so much for taking the time to help me. I feel alot better now and agree with everything you suggested. If I&amp;#8217;m ever faced with a tough quandary like this again in the future, I will definitely consult with you first! God bless and thank you again!
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;hr /&gt;

      Hi Barbara-Ann Thank you for your valuable advice it is most appreciated. I will definitely be looking at the things you suggested. You have given me some ideas I would not have thought about. Thanks &amp; Regards

      Dear Elder Wisdom Circle, Thank you so very much for your suggestions. We&amp;#8217;ll try one, but not sure which one yet. I know we will be having quite interesting conversations over the next few weeks. This is such a sensitive subject especially during the Holidays. Your website is wonderful. It&amp;#8217;s comforting to know that you would take time and careful thought into a stranger&amp;#8217;s dilemma. Happy Holidays to you and yours. And again, we thank you for your time and great suggestions. Virginia &amp; Tony

      Dear Aunt-Bella Thank you so much for your truly thoughtful reply. I have read your response many times already. It is filled with such wisdom. I can&amp;#8217;t even express how I feel, because I&amp;#8217;m still digesting it all and rolling it over and over in my mind. It&amp;#8217;s almost a blueprint or a map of where I need to go. Please don&amp;#8217;t stop giving your insights &amp;#8211; you obviously have a gift. You definitely touched this strangers life. Thank You, Sandy
    &lt;/p&gt;

      Thank you Rafiki. I had nobody else to talk to without bias. Your objectivity without judgement was appreciated. You helped more than you know.

    &lt;p&gt;
      This site is amazing it is so nice to have someone give advice just because they want to help. I will be telling all my family and friends about this site, I am so impressed with the response time. 10 out of 10 thank you so much x
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;hr /&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      Thank you for your advice, it is really helpful, I am so relieved. I thought maybe I didn&amp;#8217;t try hard enough or I was doing something wrong. I am so pleased by your email. I really felt understood because you even mentionned things that I didn&amp;#8217;t write in my email. I kept those things silent but you said it as you were here, living with him. I am greatful. Thank you again and may God bless your organisation.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      I wanted to write an update&amp;#8230;I am inspired by the good work you do and wish to be a contributing help-ee, if that makes sense. Between my elder&amp;#8217;s advice, and some time spent in reflection, I think I&amp;#8217;m starting to get it. I had to get over some family problems but I think I&amp;#8217;ve mostly done it. I thank you for running your site, you truly help people and do so in an amazingly generous manner. Thank You, Claudette
    &lt;/p&gt;

      PicklesMarie, You know what, you are right this advice isn&amp;#8217;t what I wanted to hear. BUT IT IS WHAT I NEEDED TO HEAR!! and I appreciate it and it makes perfect sense. Thank you so much. It is nice to have advice from an outside source that doesn&amp;#8217;t know our family and hear an unbiased piece of advice. I really appreciate your feedback and help it means alot and I will take it to heart!!!!! Thanks so much Nichole

      This is a follow-up email from advice sought over 3 years ago. If possible, please forward it to the elders who wrote to me. The careful and thoughtful responses you gave helped me to see the term through to the end. I wound up with a passing grade and less than $50. However, just knowing that I had other resources available, and that someone was thinking about me, was enough to keep me going. I got a job in my field that allowed me the time to work around my school schedule. I borrowed more money to pay for tuition, and the department gave me a small scholarship. The divorce was finalized within a year. One girl went to college, one girl went to work, one boy went on an exchange trip. The younger boys are still in Scouts. I met a Very Nice Man, with whom I have a tremendous friendship. And, I graduated this June with a degree in Chemistry. It was a long, hard time, and I kept going in part because of the caring words and real advice that I received here. A thousand thanks!
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      I&amp;#8217;d like to thank Candy for her great, comforting feedback. It made me feel much better about the issue I asked for advice about. Because of her helpful advice, I will continue to use this website and recommend it to others. Thanks again, Sam
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      Oh thanks, this was extremely helpful, logical and encouraging advice! I really appreciate your response and I&amp;#8217;ll share your perspective with my son Izaak. It&amp;#8217;s kind of like having a wise grandmother to go to &amp;#8211; and is very valuable to me as I don&amp;#8217;t have one of those. 🙂 Thanks again so much
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      Thank you. This has helped me very much. I did what you suggested and I asked him if he wanted to car-pool to today&amp;#8217;s football game! He said yes, and now he and I are going together. I&amp;#8217;m So happy! Again, thank you very much, your help was much obliged. Gracias Senorita! Sincerely, No-Longer Confused

      Thank you very much, Wise Elder. It&amp;#8217;s all in a nutshell for me now. I just needed to hear someone else tell me that Nothing is New, and to go on with my own life. Thanks for the reality check. I really needed that. Regards, Kathy

      You are probably the most helpful out of ANYONE I have come to for help! You definitely know what you&amp;#8217;re doing. Thank you so much! I&amp;#8217;m so glad I stumbled upon the EWC. You tapped right into my mind. I can&amp;#8217;t thank you enough! Love, Justine

      Wow, thanks so much for your reply. I agree completely with your answer, I guess I had to hear of other ways to approach this problem. Thanks so much, keep doing what you are doing, you are very good at it. GodBless you Lee

      Aondreaa, Thank you for your response. I am thankful you took the time to answer my questions and concerns. I agree with everything you have said. I feel I may have been blind to the simple things you stated. I do plan on pursuing further emotional assistance with a therapist. I am thankful www.ElderWisdomCircle.org exists. Thank you again.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      A few years ago, I sent you a letter. I just wanted to say thanks for you honest straight forward response. He never changed or was willing to compromise. I am no longer with &amp;#8216;Mr. Me Me Me!&amp;#8217; and now have am married to a wonder man who is all about &amp;#8216;we&amp;#8217;. He and I were married on Valentines Day in Vegas! It was wonderful and I&amp;#8217;m so grateful I heard you say what I knew &amp;#8211; I needed to move on and I did. Thanks again. The new &amp;#8216;Mrs.&amp;#8217;

      Hello M-Sharon, Thank you kindly for your reply. You have given me some very useful advice. I think you hit the nail on the head when you said I might be suffering from depression &amp;#8211; I will be seeing my doctor next week and will discuss it with her. I did have some counselling for depression in the past and it helped me for a while. I appreciate your help &amp;#8211; you are amazing and what you are doing is so great. Regards, J

      Dear Aunt-Molly (for you are dear to me), Since no one else in my life has the courage to speak &amp;#8220;directly&amp;#8221; as you did to me, I am grateful for your thoughtful response. I have gleaned several things from your letter, but the one that is sticking out in my mind as I go through my day is &amp;#8220;We teach people how to treat us.&amp;#8221; I think that one thing will change my demeanor in just about every circumstance I encounter. When I meet someone really special, I treat them really special. I do feel more hopeful that my friendship will endure if I let it and if I&amp;#8217;m a little more trusting. It is hard not to let the past determine the future, but seeing it in black and white makes it sound really second rate. Thank you so much for taking the time to make a difference in my life. Love, Sue
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;hr /&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      Wow thanks for sharing your wisdom with me. I am not young but value your advice. Sometimes we need to hear this from someone else. You&amp;#8217;ve been great thanks.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;hr /&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      Thank you purple Finch! That was wonderful advice. Your right if I am contributing to the community I live in then this is good and also I should be open to experiences because this is what I need to learn from. From reading your advice I am going to explore some new ideas. Maybe I need to make the most of everything I have &amp;#8211; not start again but build on what I have and am learning. Help is out there so I&amp;#8217;m going to join some classes, appreciate my family and invest more in my community. When things are ready to move it should be a simple decision because it feels right. I still have loads to learn here it&amp;#8217;s my ego saying I need more. Thank you
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;hr /&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      Dear Aunt-Molly, I cannot thank you enough, yourself and all else of the Elder Circle. What a wonderful thing you all are doing here for others. As I read your response to my letter to you, I got choked up and felt tears welling up. You&amp;#8217;ve made it so that I won&amp;#8217;t allow this very important moment to pass by. A letter full of feelings and good memories is exactly what I&amp;#8217;ll set to work on immediately upon sending this to you. I can&amp;#8217;t express enough gratitude to you for your advice. Truly, my heart feels so much lighter already. Love and thanks to you all, Anna
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;hr /&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      Thanks so much- I do feel less guilty now and the Elder&amp;#8217;s charming response had my husband doing a lot of nodding and saying, &amp;#8220;See? I told you so!&amp;#8221; We agree it isn&amp;#8217;t often he can say that so he&amp;#8217;s certainly happy : ) and I am too. I think I&amp;#8217;ll lose Patti&amp;#8217;s phone number. : )
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;hr /&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      Wow thank you so much. At first glance you are right. It&amp;#8217;s not what I want to hear but thinking about it now it makes complete sense. I&amp;#8217;ve seen it, I mean since I sent that last letter I have laid off and things seem MUCH better. You guys are great, honestly, thank you so much.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;hr /&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      Dear Aunt Molly- Thank you for your kind words and wisdom. I guess I forgot that this, like everything else we go through, is a phase. I just worry about the raised stakes, and the choices my daughter makes, which have long-lasting consequences. I really like the idea of finding something else to release her creative side. We&amp;#8217;re going to paint one wall in her room with chalkboard paint, so she can draw to her heart&amp;#8217;s content. If my parents were alive today, I think they would have said the same things you did. So I thank for for filling in for them. Your words gave me much comfort, and lots of things to think about. With love, Janet
    &lt;/p&gt;

      Hey Cheche, You gave me advice a while ago on how to move past a bad (and stupid) relationship experience. I have to say, it did help! The letter was &amp;#8220;how do you stop being angry&amp;#8221;, or something like that, and I&amp;#8217;d just like to let you know that I&amp;#8217;ve pretty much figured it out, and am talking to the guy in question again, and I think things won&amp;#8217;t be too awkward between us, which is fortunate because we go to the same university and would see each other quite often. Anyway, I just wanted to say &amp;#8216;thanks&amp;#8217;, if somewhat belatedly. Gratefully, Emma
    &lt;/p&gt;

      It felt light after speaking my heart out and i felt even lighter after reading your reply.Thank you for your reply.

    &lt;p&gt;
      The advice you have given me was a tremendous help. I wish I could siphon all your many, many years of combined wisdom into my daughter&amp;#8217;s head. You, Carolina Friends, have very practical, sound knowledge. I thank you so much. I have already practiced some of what you have advised me. It is working. Have a wonderful day. Ann

      Hello Thank you SO much for your help!! I&amp;#8217;ve tried alot of other advice websites and stuff but none of them helped! I love how you show that you really do care about me and my situation and problems and it seems like you put alot of effort in writing back to me with your best advice!! Your advice worked great! He still does have self esteem problems but we&amp;#8217;re still good friends and we&amp;#8217;re working on those problems together! He does still love me alot but I told him that he should just be greatful and happy that we&amp;#8217;re still friends and that I&amp;#8217;m still in his life and that I still do care about him but, like you said, more like a brother! Again, Thank you so much!
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      I want to say thank you to the elder for sharing his perspective and words of wisdom. I received his reply several weeks ago and have gone back to re-read it several times. I am sure I will continue to refer to it in future weeks/years as this is an ongoing situation that my family is dealing with. It was truly helpful to get feedback from someone who was not directly tied to this situation because they presented an unbiased view. Thank you so much, Elder Wisdom Circle, for offering this invaluable service. For those of us who cannot afford professional counseling, it is a Godsend.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      Hello Dawn, Thank you very much for your advise. I tried a few of them already. I will give a try to the ones I have not done yet. Thank you very much and keep me in your prayers. I will keep all of you in my prayers for the wonderful job you are doing. We, young people (I am not sure if I still fit the category) need advise from mature and experience people like you. Again, Thank you
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;hr /&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      Thank you for the advice. That really did help me. Im glad I asked you because everything seems to ease up. You know, like a weight has been lifted off of my shoulders. Thank you, once again/ ~Breanna

      Hello &amp;#8211; thank you for this most helpful and quickly answered &amp;#8216;advice&amp;#8217;. You have offered many suggestions, and I do know you are right. There are no other boy cousins, except one age 1 1/2. You&amp;#8217;ve given me &amp;#8216;food for thought&amp;#8217;, and we still have the better part of the summer to work this out. Thank you so much again. It&amp;#8217;s been a pleasure hearing back so quickly and w/such an in-depth explanation. God Bless you. Sincerely, Carol

      Once again, thank you Web for your sage advice&amp;#8230;.I wish I could carry you around in my purse and consult with you when I have a bad day! Arlene

      Dear Dawn, Thank you so MUCH for responding on the holiday!!!! Your advice sounds like something I can do. Yes, I will print off all of it. God bless you for your encouragement and empathy. It means a lot when a person is discouraged. And, yes, I do need a physical. Seems like I feel worn out all the time. I felt like walking for one mile today, for the first time in weeks. Blessings and every good wish to you!!!! Sincerely, joyce

      Hi Ruthie; Thanks for the reply. Since I did just get out of the hospital, I am not supposed to be out there messing around with my garden, but you just cannot hold back when you love your garden. My husband put a chair there for me to sit with some sheers, and I cut the old blooms off. As a matter of fact, I already saw new blooms coming. I realized at that point, that that&amp;#8217;s what I saw in the spring, and so I knew the tall stalk with a few flowers on the top were already spent. I was glad to get your email to help me decide what to do. Thank you! By the way, I live in IL, so hopefully I will get another couple blooms. I remember having flowers most of the year last year. Thank you too for your kind words about my surgery. I will get my daughter to put more Miracle Grow on the flowers. Thanks again! June

      Dear Hedwig, I just wanted to say thanks. I asked your advice a few months ago and this is what you sent me. I followed it, not exactly as closely as I should have, but nonetheless I distanced myself. Occasionally Sxxxx texts me when he&amp;#8217;s drunk (I ignore those), but other than that I have little to no problems with him. Even though I am now dating a close friend of his brother&amp;#8217;s. All in all, thank you for your advice. Thank you for listening to me. And thank you for helping. An unbiased opinion is often all anyone needs to realize the reality of a situation. So thanks. -Annie

      I am writing to thank the elder(Web)that answered my question. Often common sense isn&amp;#8217;t easy to come by when you&amp;#8217;re down. Reading the elder advice always cheers me up, and my elder&amp;#8217;s proved no exception. So, thank you a million times, my elder. Thank you for your patience and your wisdom. Claudette

      Dear Emme, Thank you for all your help and support. I don&amp;#8217;t know what I would do if I couldn&amp;#8217;t let this out to anyone. I will take all your advice and try my best to get throught this. Thank you( x 1 000 000 )

      I am so thankful that I had found your site. I am facing the world on my shoulders and I had no one to talk too and no where to turn. It gives me hope to see that there are people out there with time and experience that will offer advice to those that are lost IE me. I made a foolish mistake with a girl and I am still paying for it now. I left her for a job and she found someone else. I told her how I felt and she said she has no feelings for me. But from the advice the elders have given others there is nothing I can do and I must do what I never wanted too and &amp;#8221; move on &amp;#8221; I thank you and I hope this site stays up forever it has help keep me in balance that there is someone there that I can talk too. Sincerely, Michael

      Dear Kay Kay Thanks for responding. It is very relieving to hear from someone who has felt as I do. I think I&amp;#8217;ll take a page out of your book, &amp; talk it out about the wedding, it can surely wait an year. What you say is true. Once I go offtrack, it will take uncertain amount of time to rediscover myself. That is what was gnawing me, but I was not able put my finger on it. Many Thanks.

      Hi there. I just want to say thank you so much for your help. it really helped me sort out alot of the things going on in my head. i think sometimes its good to have an outside opinion as u get stuck and only see a small picture of events happening around you. everything u said made alot of sense to me, and it really helped to have someone not involved in some way with one thing or another to speak to. yours sincerely G
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;hr /&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      I understand&amp;#8230; Thank you for your reply. I appreciate the promptness of the message and the sincerity in your tone! Hopefully in my lifetime I can help to persuade others to see the importance of diversity and tolerance. THanks 🙂

      Dear Rechema Thank you so much for your sound advice! You are right&amp;#8230; I think deep down, I know that divorce is my only option for happiness. All along I have been telling myself that if staying in the marriage is best for the kids, then I can do this&amp;#8230;.but as of late I have been realizing that the environment is really NOT good for the kids. To hear the reality from someone else has really hit home for me. I do not want to make the mistake of messing my kids up by relying on them too much and making them the focus of my life. You are so right and I think more than anything, I appreciate your reminding me of that fact! You have no idea how much I appreciate your advice&amp;#8230;thank you. Michele
    &lt;/p&gt;

      Dear Aunt Bella, Thanks so much for your beautiful letter. It made me cry. It&amp;#8217;s so nice to hear from an impartial, experienced person. I don&amp;#8217;t know why I feel that I have to &amp;#8220;save&amp;#8221; people but I do have a history of getting into relationships with less than healthy people and hanging on for dear life. I think you hit the nail on the head. I couldn&amp;#8217;t save him from his own fears even if I devoted myself to it 27/7 and it&amp;#8217;s such a &amp;#8220;set-up&amp;#8221; for pain in the future. I also loved the &amp;#8220;you can&amp;#8217;t get enough of what you really don&amp;#8217;t want.&amp;#8221; That describes me to a &amp;#8220;T.&amp;#8221; Perhaps it&amp;#8217;s time to start going to al-anon! And I do grind my teeth! You knew! And I have for years!!! I even have one of those plastic things that you have to sleep with. Of course I don&amp;#8217;t wear it. I think I can control that too, I guess! Anyway, thanks from the bottom of my heart. You have much compassion and you are not at all judgmental. Best wishes&amp;#8230;.D
    &lt;/p&gt;

      Elder Web, Merci beaucoup, for your advice and kind encouragement. You are smart enough to have lived to be elder, and I can tell from how you write that you make the best of every day. It is a beautiful Saturday here in Ohio and I have been listening to my eight-year-old practice the piano. I will think of you as I hug my two girls and my husband tonight. I will make a donation to the Elder Wisdom Circle. Thanks again.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      Dear Aunt-Bella, I just wanted to thank you for taking the time in writing me back and helping me understand some things. No one has ever made me see things as clear as you did, and for that I want to thank you. When you said you have seen a lot of life from others and yourself, you were sure right, and I dont think any other person could of said it any better. Thank you and I will definately try to take these things into consideration, I was actually thinking of talking to the pastor while I sat in church today, so thank you so very much for your kind and intelligent words of wisdom. God Bless you Aunt-Bella!!! Sincerely, A
    &lt;/p&gt;

      I really like this website and i ask for advice whenever i can. my friends ask me for advice alot and say that i give REALLY good advice and that the things i tell them are useful and sometimes funny.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;hr /&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      Thank you so much for you advice, Elder Web! It means a lot to me, and even made me shed a tear because I don&amp;#8217;t really have a grandparent figure in my life&amp;#8211; both my grandpa&amp;#8217;s have passed away, my dad&amp;#8217;s mom suffered a stroke a couple years ago and she has never been the same since, and my other grandmother is still overcome by grief from her husband&amp;#8217;s death (so much so that she would rather talk about how lonely she is rather than my personal life). In any case, alive or not, they are all overseas, so I see them maybe once every two years. Although I am almost fluent in my mother language, and understand by and large all words, it is sometimes hard to communicate with my grandparents on the phone because terms are often hard to recall when I barely use them in my life. So thank you for your thorough response! You don&amp;#8217;t have to reply to this but I just wanted to let you know how much I appreciated your e-mail. EWC is truly a Godsend! P.S. I&amp;#8217;ll let you know how things go 🙂
    &lt;/p&gt;

      JanLynn, I want to thank you for your replies to my messages with your honesty and wise words. It has helped me a a lot. Regards to your first reply to my message, I appreciate your honesty and it helped me to see what happen and what is important as some can lose sight when going through something like this and after reading your message I have a better understanding and I respect and appreciate your help. Thank you very much JanLynn : ) Have a wonderful day!
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;hr /&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      I would like to say thank you for helping me because I forgot to say thanks in my recent advice request. I would like to donate when I am older because my parents will not allow me. I hope this website stays alive and I wish you all good luck in your own lives.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      Aunt-Molly, Thanks so much for the advice. I&amp;#8217;ve printed out your response and I&amp;#8217;m very excited to share it with my boyfriend. It seems like today&amp;#8217;s generation fails to see the importance of &amp;#8220;asking our elders&amp;#8221;. You have truly made a difference and it&amp;#8217;s greatly appreciated. Sincerely,
    &lt;/p&gt;

      Hello, Thank you so much for the insightful response . Following your advise and a few days of my own thinking , I opted to tell the guy involved that I will no longer go out on dates with him. His overall lack of communication was apparent but, the passive aggressive possible issue came into my mind too and I&amp;#8217;d rather not find myself in a dysfunctional relationship.. Better safe than sorry and I&amp;#8217;ll cut my losses at this early stage. Thanks again and you all do such wonderful work, much appreciated. Best wishes from sunny Helsinki, Finland. M.

      Wow! Thank you so much! As it were, today I followed your advice and &amp;#8220;Joe&amp;#8221; went to a local coffee shop with me. I love Elder Wisdom Circle and I appreciate the advice. KUDOS, KUDOS, KUDOS!

      Dear Dawn, Thank you very much for your advice. I appreciate it very much. I know that the &amp;#8220;one year&amp;#8217; period seems to be the magical number for any sort of serious discussion about a relationship. I guess I feel that I am more open with my offspring and him, than he is about his, however; I can wait it out. Thanks again,
    &lt;/p&gt;

      Hey Barbara, Thank you so much for your advice. Your letter was warm and made my decission even more strong not to quit this job. After all only I have to go through the pain and no one else. I will strongly follow the &amp;#8220;the work for myself&amp;#8221; bit. Thank You again
    &lt;/p&gt;

      Thank you for your reply, it was really helpful and i totally appreciate the fact that you took the time to write it. I have taken your advice on board and will act on the guidance given. Thank you so much

    &lt;hr /&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      Hello, Thanks for the excellent and well-thought-out advice! I am still digesting it, and I think it is having the effect you are essentially advising &amp;#8211; &amp;#8220;don&amp;#8217;t give up the day job.&amp;#8221; Take care! &amp;#8211; Jeff
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      Thank You so much JanLynn your advice- rather words of wisdom &amp;#8211; are truly inspiring to me. I have been really down lately and this was kind of a pick me up and a kick in the pants to really let go and stop dealing with it. Thank you again.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;hr /&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      This is so helpful and insightful, I never thought about what you said! Teachers always just seem like they&amp;#8217;re upstanding, but I completely forgot about the ones that really aren&amp;#8217;t. Thank you so much, I&amp;#8217;m going to talk to my parents about it. 🙂
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;hr /&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      Dear Elders and John G, Thanks for your kind and prompt reply. It is true, perhaps I am involving myself too much, and while I can be loving and warm, it is really up to the parent. I won&amp;#8217;t be helping either party by overdoing it. Best wishes,
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;hr /&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      Once again, thank you so much! You know, I was angry for so long, I mean I couldn&amp;#8217;t even yell at him or tell him how much it hurt me. I didn&amp;#8217;t have a best friend to turn to to complain about the situation because he WAS the best friend. But I&amp;#8217;m becoming closer with my other friends and just learning you can&amp;#8217;t always trust everyone. THANKS AGAIN &lt;3 🙂
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      I would like to thank Hedwig for her advice. I visit ElderWisdomCircle when I don&amp;#8217;t know where to turn and found them to be prompt and caring with their answers. I had previously purchased the book from ElderWisdomCircle and will make a donation for this wonderful organization. Thank you again, Hedwig. The most important thing is that Chris sees his family after so many years.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      Dear Elder Circle: Thanks so much for this advice. I feel much better. If I speak to a friend, they would spread it around or make fun of me. With Elder Circle I have privacy and confidentiality as well as true wisdom, not just the next person&amp;#8217;s opinion.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;hr /&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      Thank you so much for the quick reply. Although I realized that I already knew the answer in my heart, I was refreshed to hear it from an unbiased party. I know I have a tough decision ahead of me. Now I just need to take the first step. Thank you very much for your kind and encouraging words. All the Best, Jennifer

    &lt;p&gt;
      Thank you, Your advice is really wonderful to me and I would rather hear the honest truth, since I just can&amp;#8217;t do it myself. I do think I need to leave him, which is what I am going to do. Thank you so much.

      BG Thank you for your time and effort in helping me understand better what I have heard from my counselor and other friends as well as my mom. I can hear her words about getting busy and getting on and repairing my relationships with my kids. I have a lot of growing to do and plenty of time to learn. Your words come from your heart and I appreciate them so much. Thank you for your advice.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      To All Elders: Thank you , I can&amp;#8217;t tell you how much I appreciate your advice and how much it has helped me, sometimes all you need is someone to listen and the replies are always well thought out and not just oh ur doing fine, I can&amp;#8217;t thank you enough but here is my Thanks!
    &lt;/p&gt;

      Elder Web, Thank you so much for your reply. I knew someone would reply, but honestly I expected a few sentences. I really appreciate the time you took to write back and share your advice and your life with me. Your letter made me realize I really have been looking at this from a funny perspective. This three-month relationship seems like forever to me, because it is the first time I&amp;#8217;ve ever had a three-month anything! But it is tiny in the scheme of things. Thank you so much for your reply. Your advice basically gave me &amp;#8216;permission&amp;#8217; to do what I thought I should do anyway, and on top of it you backed it up with some experience of your own. Next time I&amp;#8217;ll know to trust the little voice inside. Thank you again, Stephen
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;hr /&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      Thank you for the advice! I just want to tell the Elder Wisdom Circle thank you. What you guys are doing is selfless and wonderful. You all are a wonderful blessing and I appreciate greatly what you are doing for other people. It&amp;#8217;s nice to have another perspective on my problems from people who are wiser than I am. God Bless and take care. -Karli

      Elder JanLynn, thank-you so much for your advice. It resonated so deeply, that I made the decision there and then. The burden of stress and anxiety has been lifted from me. I leapt out of bed this morning! God bless you, Francesca, in the UK.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      Elder Michelle, Firstly i would like to thank u so much for everything. I cannot understand why your organization won&amp;#8217;t get some kind of funding because it has really helped me in my time of need. When i felt that i could not speak to anybody else about my problems your advise really helped me through my pain. From the bottom of my heart i would like to sincerely thank u so very much. Its hard to find genuine people out there not asking for money and because of that i will definately donate to the EWC because you guys deserve a lot more. I will try my hardest to put the advise i was given in my head, its just going to be very hard.. The way Elder Michelle put it to me was in a perfecte way, even giving me a perfect example. I strongly believe u guys do a better job than paid professionals! Thank u so much and i will definately be in touch soon. Jess
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;hr /&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      Sir Thank you for the advice and guidance. I retained portions of your advice over the last 6-7 months and they have really helped me. Basically, as advised, I &amp;#8220;kept my head down,&amp;#8221; stayed silent, have worked hard, etc. Again, thank you for your advice, you clarified things for me as well as provided direction and helped me stay on task instead of getting fed up and moving on or out. Thanks. Matt
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;hr /&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      I have used this service maybe 3 times and I just want to tell you all that you guys are amazing! Your generosity is priceless and the fact that you are doing this out of the kindness of your heart is incredible. Thank you.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;hr /&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      I would just like to thank you very much for your advice, it was very, very helpful! I appreciate that you think I have made a good decision . You pinpointed my exact reasons for dropping out &amp; gave me just the advice I needed, that I believe will get me through. After reading your answer I&amp;#8217;ve decided to contact a counselour before hand &amp; inform the bootcamp about my anxiety issues/ homesickness . I just wanted to let you know how very helpful you were &amp; how I am very grateful. Thanks again, &amp; God bless you. With much relief, Meaghan
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      Elder Dawn,Thank you so much. I am not positive what I&amp;#8217;ll do from here just yet, but having your insight is really helpful. Often when looking to a peer for help, it&amp;#8217;s hard to find someone who will not only listen, but will respond with wise intuition. Your wisdom that comes along with age and experience is something I truly respect and admire. Your response was not only helpful in content, but structured without any offensive assertions. Thank you for your time and help. I really appreciate it.Melissa
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;hr /&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      Thank you for having the same Elder respond again I just want to thank you for the thoughtful response. It may seem like a small thing, but your responses really helped me put things in perspective and actually confirmed some of my inner thoughts. This is a great service that you offer. I am sending a very personal kudo and sincere thanks to the Elder who answered me both times. I also wish you much happiness.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      Thank you, Elder Candy. Three of four siblings are in agreement with your advice! Thanks again for your kind wisdom. I am very impressed with this service. I love the idea of bouncing things off of others and what a neat program this is for all concerned! I will be making a contribution!
    &lt;/p&gt;

      Uncle-Tony, Thank you so much for your reply. This has confirmed my latest feelings about my situation and I guess this has given me a bit more confidence in telling these two boys my plan. Each time I use EWC I get great responses. I&amp;#8217;m very glad that I found this as a resource and hope that it will continue to grow and help people. Sincerely, Rayna

      Barbara, Thank you so much for your response. Your understanding and advice was perfect. I haven&amp;#8217;t got back with my ex, but we are back in contact and on good terms. Your thoughts were true. Because of what you said, I was able to understand how she was feeling and contact her with a clear head. I have also started to look at myself and my own problems. I don&amp;#8217;t know how things will end up, but since I read your email, I have been a much happier person. I am replying to your email to let you know what a huge difference you have made. There are very few people out there like you, so I would like to say a big thank you. Its hard to show the impact of what you said in an email. After your advice, I saw my ex a couple of days ago. At first, it was very awkward. And horrible seeing a good friend look so uncomfortable. But with your advice in my head, we talked and I saw a huge smile on her face appear. You made someone happy. Thank you. Regards, Kevin.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      Hello, Thank you so much for your advice. I really appreciate it, and will take your advice, and stay here so my children do not have to move again. Your advice means so much to me at just the right time. Noone here ever talks this blunt and straight to me, and I really appreciate it. My sincere gratitude, love and blessings to gpa-and-gma. hugs too!
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;hr /&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      Thank you for a beautiful and well written response to my question. It made me cry and smile. Sometimes I feel so alien and your advice made me feel normal and ok. God Bless You and Thank You from the bottom of my heart, Joe

    &lt;p&gt;
      WOW! Thanks Tina. It&amp;#8217;s so ironic that I was asking about how I can stop overthinking, and with all the thinking I was doing I couldn&amp;#8217;t come up with this answer myself! hahaha. Well, thanks again. I have a WAY more clear idea of what I should do and how to enjoy myself.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;hr /&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      Dear Michelle, I just wanted to write to you and say THANK YOU! The advice that you gave me was truly helpful. It&amp;#8217;s like you really sensed/understood what I was (still am) going through and it so touched me that I cried. I will take your advice and focus on centering myself, not make any serious financial decisions now, do my utmost in forgetting the past and will try to live in the now and take joy from everything I can. Once again I truly appreciate the advice given and I thank you so very much! Fatima
    &lt;/p&gt;

      Dear Elder Jacobus, I would like to thank you for the very helpful advice. I have come to this site once before and I can&amp;#8217;t help but tell my friends and family how nice is it to have someone to talk to that is able to see the situation from a different perspective. The advice and time you&amp;#8217;ve taken out of your day is truly appreciated. Once again, thank you for your time and truly helpful advice. I am beginning to see the situation more clearly and I know that this all had to happen for a reason. I hope that you are having a nice day and I really do appreciate your advice. Thank you, Mallory
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;hr /&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      I was surprised to read your advice to follow my instincts and re-read my own email. But I did. Wow! What a shock! All the answers were there. It was so clear that I didn&amp;#8217;t want to go through with this and that there were so many problems already. I realized I knew what I needed to do and I had been ignoring my gut for a long, long time. This was a good lesson in trusting myself and knowing what&amp;#8217;s best for me. Since this email last week, I have started counseling, I broke up with my boyfriend (who seemed more upset that I wasn&amp;#8217;t going to take care of him anymore than that we were ending a relationship) and I&amp;#8217;m feeling really strong and am listening to myself much more. Thank you.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;hr /&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      Dear Web, Thank you so much for your very thoughtful advice. Growing up I never had grandparents to turn to for advice so I really appreciate the wisdom and experience that you bring. My sister and I have a great relationship and I&amp;#8217;m trying to get the courage to call her and try to mend the situation. One thing that you said that stood out was &amp;#8220;a reprimand is not a punishment.&amp;#8221; Maybe I could mention this to my sister and hope that this advice could help her. Again, thank you so much for all your help! Best regards, Rowena
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;hr /&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      Wow Michelle!!! I didn&amp;#8217;t expect this response. I would like to thank you for your time and wise advice&amp;#8230; I expected &amp;#8220;wake up and smell the coffee&amp;#8221;&amp;#8230; Give love a chance&amp;#8230; Brilliant advice. You are right he has had a rough life and I do love him. Thank you, thank you, thank you!!!!

    &lt;p&gt;
      Reading back my question and your response-I am just wondering why I have let myself go this long hoping and waiting for something to change when it isnt going to. What an eye opening response- from a complete stranger-My family has been telling me I am like a woman being beaten every day-and just keep staying-even though he doesnt use fist, it still hurts. But when a complete stranger can see it- and I have only given some of the &amp;#8220;bad&amp;#8221;-I really feel like an idiot-thank you-my children thank you&amp;#8211; Cindy

      Thank you sssoooooo much, your response made me cry. I was double guessing myself and running everything back through my mind. I feel so much better now. You don&amp;#8217;t need to respond &amp;#8211; you said it all &amp;#8211; :o)&amp;#8230;&amp;#8230;&amp;#8230;&amp;#8230;&amp;#8230;&amp;#8230;&amp;#8230;&amp;#8230;and as a side note, my Husband agrees with me. He&amp;#8217;s not happy with the situation but believes that we didn&amp;#8217;t do anything wrong. PS&amp;#8230;.and you are right &amp;#8211; I am blessed with really cool folks who are just the best!!!

      I want to say think you to the group of Elders who replied to me. Although it is in the depths of my email inbox buried under college emails and facebook notifications, that advice has stuck with me. I was having issues with two men who were dear to me and I finally listened to what you told me and am incredibly happy. Thank you.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      Elder, I literally cried when I read your advice. You see , everyone is afraid to tell me what you just did and what I so needed to hear even though I have ask and ask for advice from everyone. You were right on the money on this one. I appreciate your advice and will most assuredly take it and smile while doing so. You have taken a great weight off of my mind and a lift off of my shoulders. I feel so much better. This service is wonderful. Thank you so much for being my sounding board. I hope you have as great a success in giving advice to others as you have to me. Thank you for the uplift, No more used , abused and confused Now: Unused, wont be abused and very amused ! I will be able to say NO !
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;hr /&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      WOW. Your response literally brought tears to my eyes. It was a huge comfort to know that you and your son have both served for our country, and I have the utmost respect for the both of you. After reading your response, I feel much more at ease with what&amp;#8217;s going on in my world. Thank you sooooo very much, and it&amp;#8217;s nice to actually get an unbiased opinion. 😀
    &lt;/p&gt;

      Elder Terry, What terrific advice. My wife and I will remain in contact . As it turns out his wife doesn&amp;#8217;t know he spoke to m and I turn with my wife. I will have to let him break the news to her that my wife and I know that something is up. What a great service this is. Thanks Dave

      I want to thank Helen for responding to my email. It always helps to hear what we &amp;#8220;think&amp;#8221; might be true or things we forget when we are in the thick of it. I&amp;#8217;m going to save Helen&amp;#8217;s response and print it out to read when I&amp;#8217;m feeling down at work or shakey about my choices. I love this service! There&amp;#8217;s lots of us out here who either come from families too dysfunctional to be of much help, or in some cases, those who don&amp;#8217;t have family. Thank you again. It was just what I needed to hear, honestly. :)amber

      Dear Buttercup, What a lovely and thoughtful response! I really enjoyed reading your email. You seem like a soulful lady who has enjoyed much richness in life. Good for you!! And thank you for being so willing to take the time to share your thoughts. I spent a lot of time alone this weekend and it felt great! I agree that many people can enjoy a lifetime with various people and that there is not one &amp;#8220;soul mate&amp;#8221; for every person. I certainly enjoy this guy and want to keep exploring our possibilities as a couple. Thank you so much again. It sounds like you are not at a loss for enjoying your own free time or finding ways to enrich the lives of others! Your kindness is much appreciated. Your new friend, Jennifer

      Dear Elder Oliver, Thank you for the advice. When I read that what I needed was emotional support my worries calmed and an AHA! moment arrived. That is exacly what I needed I had just been to worried to accept it. Just reading that someone else believed that was what I needed, in some sense gave me emotional support. THANKYOU SO MUCH I feel like I just regained my strengh the same kind of strengh that a hug offers. This site is a blessing.

      Arianne, a few years back you responded to my letter, &amp;#8216;the love of my life.&amp;#8217; I wanted to tell you your advice was right on the money. I was very upset about a married man I was seeing. Although I have stopped seeing this fellow, I still think about him every day. But I also think of your kind and wise advice every day, too. I have never met you, of course, but I wish I could give you a great big hug. You&amp;#8217;re a wonderful person. Kind regards, Luann

      Dear CHR, Thank you so much for responding with such positivity. I felt better the moment I read your reply. I actually had not looked at the situation that way or thought that perhaps it was in my best interest that the relationship ended with minimal damage. The idea of someone somewhere who takes time to understand is really wonderful. Thanks again and know that you made a difference in my perspective. Brooke

      Dear Candy, your kind words after putting my beloved cat &amp;#8220;to sleep&amp;#8221; were of great comfort to me. It was very difficult and I needed to hear what you had to say.

      Dear Buttercup, Thank you SO MUCH for your advice!!!!! (#125736) I tried what you said and talked to my mom about it. She said that she was sorry and that she would try harder. she didn&amp;#8217;t even raise her voice! I am SO EXTREMELY grateful to you. Oh, and by the way, I had a sleepover the other night&amp;#8230;and YIKES! I&amp;#8217;m glad that my mom is mine. thanks again!! Brooke

      Dear Helping-Hearts Thank you so much for being there in my trying times. I just wanted to share the good news with you that all issues have been resolved and we are 1 happy family again. The guy looks extremely remorseful and I guess deserves 1 more chance. Though I&amp;#8217;ve decided to keep an eye on his internet activities on regular basis. Thank you once again for all the support advice offered. Regards Jyoti

      Hi Elder Jacobus&amp;#8230; You responded to a letter of mine about my decisions concerning a new and first relationship&amp;#8230; I felt so grateful for your advice, and it made me feel more connected and hopeful in humanity. I hope you can understand how much I appreciate your time and effort, and I hope that I can talk to you again and ask for your beyond caring advice in the future. Thank you so much again, I had nowhere else to turn, and I think in my own way I found a guardian Angel that I never used to believe in. Best wishes, and take care always. Ashlee

      Thank you for taking the time to consider and respond to my dilemma. Work related events in recent months had taken a greater toll than I had fully realised making it difficult for me to consider my immediate career options clearly and unemotionally. In the time between sending my question and receiving your reply, I decided to take a proactive step and visit my (potential) new employer at his worksite. It was well worth the four hour round trip. I was most impressed and heartened by what I saw. The new organisation is keener than ever, now, to have me on board. I know that I can accept their offer on my own terms and for a duration convenient to me. I am deeply grateful for your assistance and somewhat relieved that we reached the same conclusion. I have yet to sign a contract, but negotiations are underway as are plans for my own enterprise. Warmest wishes, Renata

      Dear Elder Wisdom (PicklesMarie) It has been nearly a year since you offerred me this excellent advice. I followed your recommendation and the response by my wife was overwhelmingly positive. I know it has taken a long time for me to reply, but I wanted you to know that I appreciated your advice, and my wife is even more beautiful than ever &amp;#8211; hairdo and all. Thank you Bill D.

      I received a reply from Elder John G. re: letter 123233. I want to say thank you. The advice and insight were very helpful. Deep down, I know the matter at hand is with me and is something I need to work on. Elder John validated this. The additional information about the loss of a relationship is spot on. I grew up with this other person so, in a way, I feel like I&amp;#8217;ve lost him. This has now become a chapter in my life I must close and move on.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      Tell-Tom, Your advice was really on point! Thank you so, so much 🙂 It&amp;#8217;s Monday and I&amp;#8217;ve already sought out help from various shelters. A few have denied me as they have no space for a new born but I&amp;#8217;ve atleast begun the process. This is a hurtful situation for me in every way but I&amp;#8217;m on the road to safety and security. I truly appreciate your firm words and direction. I knew the right thing to do already but needed confirmation. Keep up the good work and God bless you. The Elder Wisdom Circle is surely appreciated. Takeya

      Elder Web, I wanted to tell you how much your recent reply helped me! First, thank you for your insight and advice that was exactly on target! And the last part!! I really liked that you said &amp;#8216;If you wish, let me know how things are going.&amp;#8217; That small statement made me feel like I mattered even to a stranger. I am starting to put my plans in action and taking my life back. I have discussed my problem/plans with my sons,they are ready to move my things to safe storage on a days notice. I would like to let you know how it is progressing from time to time if that&amp;#8217;s still o.k. ?? You have been an amazing amount of help to me! You are very good at this! I am glad I found this site!

      Dear Aunt Molly: When I first read your response to me, I wished so much that I could know you. But then I realized that I do know you and always have. You are the essence of love, caring and compassion that we all carry within us. I do know you, even though I sometimes forget I do. Thank you so much for your response. You asked if I had &amp;#8220;ever shed those tears?&amp;#8221; After reading your response to me, indeed I did release a lot of hurt and emotions that, like you suspected, were bottled up inside of me. I will save your message to me forever. Thank you so much for your understanding and for sharing your wisdom with me. I lost my Mom about 4 years ago to a nasty bout of cancer and I&amp;#8217;ve felt a deep void since. But now I have an Aunt Molly. Thank you for being there for me! With aloha, Eric

This service is so great-helps you get a prospective that is confidential and heartfelt and sincere&amp;#8211;just what you need in a crisis. Thankyou so much Dawn. Sincerely Donna.

      Thank you so much for your advice &amp;#8211; I told my boyfriend everything tonight and his response was, basically, that he loves me, he&amp;#8217;s not going anywhere, and he thinks I&amp;#8217;m incredibly strong for being who I am. I might not be over everything but knowing that there are people in the world who don&amp;#8217;t think less of me, and that there are people who love me, helps immeasurably. Thank you so much for your reply. I really don&amp;#8217;t think I would have gone through with it otherwise, and my relationship would have suffered. As it is, I think I&amp;#8217;m closer to moving on from what happened 🙂 Thank you with all my heart

      I recently asked for some relationship advice and was responded too very timely and respectfully by Gma-and- Gpa. I just wanted to say thank you first of all for donated your wisdom to others and to myself. I think it is a most wanderful thing that we have people alike these elders in our society willing to help those in need of advice. Alike fine wine, they grow all the sweeter with age. After reading the reply, I heard what i have told myself a million times. that I need to seriously get in touch with who it is I call &amp;#8220;myself&amp;#8221;. I perhaps just needed to hear it from someone else. I know that she does truely love me, and I her, and that she was also young in her decisions. Thank you again, and I say this with all the love and admiration i can muster for all the elders within this medium.. There is a special place in Heaven at the right hand of the Lord for people like you. Guardian angels do exist, there just havn&amp;#8217;t recieved their wings yet.. Thank you elders.. Michael

      Gpa-and-Gma Thank you for your advice with regard to mending a long time friendship. From the few people I sought advice from, you were the only ones who told me that I was wrong and that I needed to take the first step to mend my friendship. I am glad I listened to you, as my friend and I are again on speaking terms, and I think we both learned a lot from this experience. Again, a heartfelt thank you. Darcel

      Hi Aunt-Molly, i don&amp;#8217;t know if you&amp;#8217;ll remember me, but i&amp;#8217;m the girl who was deciding whether or not to quit softball. i just wanted to let you know that i did decide to quit. i had my father call the coach to explain, and the next day i spoke to the coach personally. i thanked him for his time and i appologized because i knew i had a commitment to the team. i then explained that my grades were slipping and i had some family issues that i needed to resolve. i ended by saying that i used to enjoy the sport, but i feel that it&amp;#8217;s too competitive and i need to focus on other things in my life. he seemed to understand and thanked me for being so &amp;#8220;responsible and thinking through the choice&amp;#8221;. i want to thank you for helping me make this choice, i feel really good about it and i feel you understand my problem. thank you so much for all you have done!
    &lt;/p&gt;

You all should be so proud and give your selfs a giant pat on your backs for helping so many people in need! I&amp;#8217;m so greatful to PicklesMarie responded so quickly to my email and what great advice she gave me. From the bottom of my heart thank you sweeti and bless you.

      Thank you for answering back so quick. Your advice sure cut deep but it&amp;#8217;s o.k. I wanted and needed the truth. Yes, you are right&amp;#8230;.we all make choices. But sometimes the choices are not always the &amp;#8220;right&amp;#8221; choices. Like with my decicision to start smoking at age 16. And with my daughter&amp;#8217;s decicision to marry this man. As for her being happy&amp;#8230;..she says she is but her actions do not prove it. She is depressed most of the time and her demenor shows it. But I will stay out of the rift between my 2 daughters. I guess I knew this all along, I just needed to have an unbiased person to say it. Thank you once again from the bottom of my heart.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      Elder Web, I can not thank you enough for your help. There is great comfort in the experienced guidance of those who are my senior. Having recently lost my Dad, it was extra special to me to hear advice from an elder male on the issue I am facing. It was like receiving a gift wrapped in wisdom. I feel relieved and better able to do the right thing now that I have heard from someone who has clearly given careful thought and insight to some of lifes bumps in the road. Thank you for providing a gentle sense of direction for me. I will forever be grateful and hope I can grow into earning a place in the special circle of sages one day. (Insert smile here). Thank you so much Web! Deb

      THANK YOU sooo much. I&amp;#8217;m so surprised at how much thought you put into your response and I couldn&amp;#8217;t agree more with you. I loved your insight and it is nice to get someone&amp;#8217;s opinion that doesn&amp;#8217;t know me inside and out. I&amp;#8217;ll admit I&amp;#8217;m still confused about some things, but I definitely agree that I wouldn&amp;#8217;t be good for anyone &amp;#8230; I&amp;#8217;ve been telling my best friend this for a couple of years &amp;#8211; You probably already guessed that something happened in my past that has made me Overly concerned about MOI (me). I think that since I&amp;#8217;m comfortable being alone, I&amp;#8217;m just going to stay that way. Again, I am so amazed at the effort you put in this, you are truly a good soul. Take care, and thanks again. Cindy

      I feel so fortunate to have found this amazing resource! I sent in my request not really knowing what to expect. I discovered a reply which was compassionate, intelligent and soothing. Now I can come back down to earth and live my life on a more real level and toss away the superficial luggage I was carrying around. Thank you!
    &lt;/p&gt;

      I have an unusual problem and didn&amp;#8217;t know what to expect from your site. Kenti&amp;#8217;s answer came just when I needed it, and she helped clarify my mind. If she is an example of the quality people you all are, this site is a treasure. God bless you all. James

      I would just like to thank you Texas-Grandpa for your advice. It seems so simple to understand my situation now somebody has offered an unbiased opinion. The advise given was so hepful, I don&amp;#8217;t know how to thank you (except to make a donation of course&amp;#8230;which I am going to do!) I shall also be recommending your service. Thank you again&amp;#8230;I am extremey grateful for your help.

      Hello Tell-Tom, Thank you for your prompt reply. It is good hear from someone who has had a personal experience that is so similar. God Bless you for your support. I especially liked your term &amp;#8221; defiantly independant but lacking in judgement&amp;#8221;. That hits the nail on the head. I will re -read your reply when I feel overwhelmed. Thank you, Linda

      Thank u so much for your advice, it is down to earth and made a lot of sense. Thank you for not judging me :). He has made effort and I probably overreacted, but your advice put a lot of things in perspective for me. Thank you ,Elder Dawn! This is a wonderful website!!!

      Thanks again for all of your help for my needs of advice. I was never any good at solving problems by myself. Having the elder circle makes me feel like I have more options and a better chance at making the right choices in life. Thank you all so much.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      Elder Barbara, Thank you so much for your heart felt and thoughtful advice. I felt so much better after reading your response, almost like I wasn&amp;#8217;t so alone in this world. I like to inform you that I did find a better job, paying and otherwise, and that I am working on healing the &amp;#8220;me&amp;#8221; inside. I am working on standing up for myself. It is hard work, but it is nice to know that you were able to do so in your life. That gives me hope for my future. I will inform everyone I know about your wonderful service. Thank you Thank you thank you, and may you be surrounded by blessings and joy. Nicole 🙂

      I just want to thank you PicklesMarie for the advice you gave me about one year plus ago. I&amp;#8217;m not sure if you can remember now. I talked about an exam that I took which I did not succeed at initially and this gave me problems. I felt I had failed in life. But you advised me on how to cope and that helped a lot. I want you to know that when I re-took the test that December, I passed with just a little itch and now I&amp;#8217;m progressing with my studies. I also want you to know that I&amp;#8217;m now experiencing a better quality of life much of which is because I learned from my mistakes as you advised and I also discovered a lot about myself through that trying period of anguish, pain and depression. Maybe if you try and look back, you&amp;#8217;ll remember me. Thank you very much once again for all the help.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;hr /&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      I wanted to thank you for assisting me through an intense personal struggle. It was really great to have someone neutral to listen and be there to help through a difficult situation. I really appreciate that Elder BG shared their heart and soul at my time of most need. Thank you Thank you Thank you&amp;#8230;
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;hr /&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      When times were especially tough I wrote you a letter. Someone gave me some very good advice (I can&amp;#8217;t remember who). My wife and I are happy now and we are living a beautiful small town with a new job. Thanks! jim

      Thank you so much for the advice! It really helps to have someone (or many people) who have had a lot of life experiences to offer advice and wisdom. Thank you for your help, keep doing what you are doing because it&amp;#8217;s so nice to have someone to talk to. You guys have helped me though some really difficult decisions and tough times. It&amp;#8217;s people like you who make our lives better and help us get through those tight situations. Thank you, I really can&amp;#8217;t say enough. I know I will probably have difficult times in the future; it&amp;#8217;s comforting to know that there is a community out there of people who care, who offer advice to better the lives of those who are a little misguided.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;hr /&gt;

      Advice from this website has now helped me get through two of the toughest situations I&amp;#8217;ve ever had to face. Thank you to whoever started this group, and to the elders for their help!

      Here I am a year later and I am happier than I have ever been! I knew in my heart the information that you suggested, however I needed to hear it from someone else since I was so insecure in my own decision making abilities. I am happier than I have ever been and I wanted to say thank you. Thank you again, Charlotte

      Comments: I just wanted to take a little time out to let you know that I think this web site is great! It&amp;#8217;s so nice to know that it&amp;#8217;s available and please keep up the good work. Your advice to others is just wonderful! No BS just straight to the point, common sense!! I myself am in my early thirties and still wet behind the ears. I am glad this is available to all of us who need a little advice from our elders from time to time. Sincerely, Nakia

      I would like to recommend this site to others who are struggling. So many of us either don&amp;#8217;t have someone to confide in, or someone that can look at the situation from an outsiders perspective. I know that your organization is there for me and people like me, who need sage words of advice and maybe a wake-up call. You are appreciated. Thank you, Melissa

Again thank you iv allways known the way of the youth is through the wisdom of elders, please continue to grow as our society is in desperate need of work such as you are doing. Anything I can do to help i shall peace and thanks Dan

      I just wanted to thank you all for the helpful advice and wise words you sent me.

I am having fun planning my future. Thank you for listening and sending me advice to think about and ultimatly take. Patrice

      Dear Ones; I want to thank the elder that responded to my letter. The response was gentle and thought provoking. I think I knew all along that this relationship would not end in a committment to a life together. Last night I gave my friend a decision to make: He could get a divorce and continue in this relationship or not get a divorce and end it. He was very hurt and has tried to make me feel guilty for &amp;#8220;ending it this way&amp;#8221;. I don&amp;#8217;t feel guilty, I feel like a deserve better from a man that claims to love me. Thank you again, V
    &lt;/p&gt;

      Hello! I recieved advice from you a couple of months ago and it was so very helpful. I have now come through the situation as postively as possible. Thank-you very much!
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;hr /&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      I can&amp;#8217;t thank you enough for your advice. I know there are more serious problems than mine, and I should be counting my blessings that this is as bad as it is, but nevertheless, its nice to know that someone is on my side. Thanks again 🙂 -A

    &lt;p&gt;
      Thank you for your reply. It was just nice to be able to talk to someone about this problem, it felt like a burden being lifted off of my shoulders. Even though I knew what I needed to do before I wrote you, your reply confirmed it. I will take a step towards forgiveness, one day at a time.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;hr /&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      Wow. This reply actually motivated me to send an e-mail to my mother. I know in person or even over the phone would be better, but I do not do well with conflict and it is easier for me to e-mail. Thanks Again! Emily

      I just wanted to let you know what a truly thoughtful response I recieved from Rose&amp;#8230;.. it is so wonderful to know that there are still caring people in the world today. She gave me excellent advice. After the links she gave me I also learned of the many people who have family members in the same situation as my sister. The advice she gave was so helpful and I appreciate the effort she put into it. Thank you to everyone.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      Shreya and EWC- Wow. I found this reply amazingly well put and sensitive, and to the point. I think this is a great organization and thank you so much for taking the time to answer. What a great group you all are. I am going to print out Shreya&amp;#8217;s response and keep it with me for a pep talk when things get hard. I appreciate you sharing your personal experiences. You don&amp;#8217;t know how much your input is appreciated. Thank you so much. Sincerely, Joan

      Having just read my reply from Rosebud, I would just like to say a HUGE thankyou. To hear the advice from someone else is a reassurance and a piece of mind. I will definately be using this service again, though I hope I won&amp;#8217;t be needing to! THANKS

      Dear PicklesMarie, Thank you so much for your thoughtful suggestions and advice! Your guidance has helped me very much in this situation. My fiance and I had a heart to heart talk and he has assured me that this living situation is only temporary (1yr max). He knows how I feel and agrees that it is not fair if we have to be responsible for supporting her and accommodating for her, especially when we can&amp;#8217;t afford it and we&amp;#8217;re just beginning our lives together. A huge cloud has cleared up for me and I can feel better about this now. Thank you so much for lending me your ear and your heart. Best regards, Thuy

      Thank you very much for your thoughts. I re-read your comments twice, and plan to read several more times, and slip a copy of it into my journal. Your advice has helped me have a clearer perspective on not just this relationship, but with my own motives and attitudes. Thank you again, and best wishes! Andrea

      Thanks Elder Dawn, I feel better, I am happy you didn&amp;#8217;t judge me, or try to tell me to get over this, as other people did. Your advice was calm and wise, and helped me a lot. Thanks!
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;hr /&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      This advice is extremely uplifting and so helpful. You have made me feel comfortable and so much better as a result of your amazing advice. I don&amp;#8217;t know how to thank you enough. Your reply brought tears to my eyes. In deep appreciation, Jennifer

      Dear Elders of the Rocky Mountain Owls, Your letter washed over me like sweet rain -thank you -no one is home right now but me and the baby and this letter has given me a feeling of relief and release that I cannot really explain- I just can&amp;#8217;t stop crying thank you &amp;#8211; I have tried so hard- thank you for letting me know its ok to let go &amp;#8211; I am printing this letter and folding it up very small to keep in my purse for when I need to read it or just hold it in my hand to rember a kindness -while I begin making necessary changes in my life &amp;#8211; thank you for bring a friend &amp;#8211; if you do not mind i will write again someday when I have good news. Catherine
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;hr /&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      The advice that was given from your elder was fantastic. I feel as though my letter was really understood. Thanks for your help.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;hr /&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      I can&amp;#8217;t thank everyone involved with EWC enough! I have always recieved meaningful &amp; very helpful advice, and as a 14-year-old girl, it is such a huge relief to know that no matter how insignificant my problems or worries may seem, there is always someone out there who is willing to offer advice. All my love &amp; gratitude!
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;hr /&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      I am amazed at your fair and wise advice. Thank you so very much. It is a great comfort to hear this from someone outside of our family circle.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;hr /&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      I was very impressed with the time and thought that went into the reply I received. The time and attention, in addition to the the great thoughts and ideas, makes me want to think of a lot more questions. LOL. What a great gift. I will take into consideration all that was written. Thank you for your time and help. M
    &lt;/p&gt;

      I have no elders in my family so it is wonderful to know that when I am just at a loss on how to handle a problem, especially with my children, I can turn to you all. You are wonderful. Blessings to you.

      Dear Cirrus, I don&amp;#8217;t know how to thank you for your kind words. Please accept a *virtual hug* from me! I also am in awe of the fact that such a truly accomplished person has written to me. It&amp;#8217;s amazing. It&amp;#8217;s very hard to find selfless and compassionate people in today&amp;#8217;s world. I&amp;#8217;m glad I found you. Thank you for understanding me so perfectly. Regards, Saaima
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;hr /&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      I wanted to write to express my appreciation for the prompt and detailed response to the question. One thing that stood out was the good advice on &amp;#8220;taking on one thing at a time.&amp;#8221; I see more clearly that I have been trying to solve multiple problems all at once instead of giving myself a break and taking little steps to alleviate some of my suffering. I also appreciate the reminder that I need to live in the now, instead of dwelling on the past hurts and the future anxieties.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;hr /&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      I just wanted to say thank you so much, to both Aunt Patty and to EWC for providing this service. The insight and caring in this response almost brought tears to my eyes. I will save this email and read it when I feel overwhelmed with trying to protect my son. Thank you, Aunt Patty, for your wisdom and for sharing your own experiences. A big hug to you, Rachel
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;hr /&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      I would like to thank Digit for his/her androgynous reply! How lovely to have my doubts calmed. I am going to adopt the philosophy that everyone needs a hug, and will give and receive them as often as I can.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;hr /&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      I am very grateful for the prompt and sincere advice I have received. It made such a difference to my sense of well-being to only receive and read such a well-considered, objective, kind and reassuring response. I hope that you will communicate my gratitude to Uncle-Tony, the elder who guided me. I would like to say that I consider EWC to be a direly needed service in the rather orphaned world of today, where the sincere selfless advice of a well-wisher and the wise affectionate guidance of elders is becoming harder to come by, even in a traditional society like my India.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;hr /&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      Elder Nancy&amp;#8230; whomever you are. You sound like such a wonderful person. My eyes started to tear when I read your reply. And to be honest, I didn&amp;#8217;t think I&amp;#8217;d get an e-mail back from anyone. I do agree with everything you have wrote and I will go get that movie tomorrow. I thank you so much for writing me back. It means a lot. And I wish to speak to you more. I feel you have a lot to tell me, and to maybe open my eyes. I agreed to go to Greece &amp;#8211; I leave soon. I wish you the best in every little thing in life.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;hr /&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      Aunt Patty you are wonderful in every way. You went through every thing I am going through now. Even though I do not know you I love you. Thanks
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      My face is wet with tears after reading the response from Web, the &amp;#8220;elder&amp;#8221; who responded to my inquiry. I am grateful beyond belief for his heartfelt words. It meant so much more coming from a man. Because I know my father would have wanted me to be safe&amp;#8211;his words were caring wisdom that took the place of my own father&amp;#8217;s voice. This service is a lifesaver&amp;#8230; in a moment when I had nowhere else to turn, you gave me a solid bit of hope to stand on. Thank you.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      I want to SINCERELY THANK BARBARA for her words of Kindness &amp; Thoughtfulness. Her taking the time to give me some advice and share w/ me her experiences showed me that I&amp;#8217;m not the only person out there in this situation. Again, THANKS SO MUCH BARBARA YOU WERE A LIFELINE TO ME. LOVE, LISA

      This site is monumental!! I received advice for my problem in such a kind and timely manner. I know this may sound a bit silly, but I don&amp;#8217;t feel as alone anymore! Thank you from the bottom of my heart!
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;hr /&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      Thank you for your helpful and sympathetic advice. I think I just needed someone to hear me and let me know I was going to be ok. I appreciate you elders taking the time to listen and respond thoughtfully to my situation.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      I just opened up my latest issue of Real Simple magazine and saw the &amp;#8220;blurb&amp;#8221; about EWC in the front of it. What a fantastic idea! I Immediately went to the website to submit a request for advice. Due to the overwhelming volume, I was not able to submit it yet, but I look forward to checking back frequently until I can. In the meantime, I browsed the replies received by other readers. What a blessing to have you!!!!!! Keep up the good work. It is MUCH NEEDED in today&amp;#8217;s society.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;hr /&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      Thank you so much for your advice! I&amp;#8217;m not able to stay at home with my twins as suggested, but I have changed my perception of what is really important. Thank you for your wisdom and experience, it helps to have a kind stranger peeking in and assessing your situation in a way you never could. Thanks!
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;hr /&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      I wanted to say the advice helped me on deciding what to do about my now ex- boyfriend. so thank you so much, It is amazing what you all are doing on here!
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;hr /&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      Just a note to thank EWC &amp; particularly Elders Dawn and David-Edward who advised me re: my brother&amp;#8217;s death. Thank you so much; you helped me through the fog.

      Thank you Elder Wisdom Circle! I feel blessed to have discovered this site. Without a doubt, those who have lived life and survived a myriad of challenges are in the best position to provide advice based upon &amp;#8220;20/20 hindsite&amp;#8221;.

    &lt;hr /&gt;

      Elder NATOHTA-MAHKESES I just had to respond back to you, not only to thank you for your advice, but to tell you that when i got to the end of your letter and read that you are a American Indian grandmother, i broke down, you see my grandmother raised me and she was always there for me. I lost her 10 years ago, but it feel&amp;#8217;s like only yesterday, how i miss her. My grandmother was also an Indian (Cherokee).I belive God did guide me to The Elder Wisdom Circle and to you. As for your advice, I will do just that, Thank You for your time,advice and most of all your prayer&amp;#8217;s. Take Care, and you are in my prayers too. God Bless, Sincerely, Evonne
    &lt;/p&gt;

      I just have to say I think you all are wonderful It&amp;#8217;s nice to know there&amp;#8217;s a &amp;#8220;grandparent&amp;#8221; out there when I need one. I&amp;#8217;ve always gone to my grandparents when I needed advice or direction. I&amp;#8217;ve always found them helpful. Keep doing what you&amp;#8217;re doing, I think it&amp;#8217;s great!
    &lt;/p&gt;

      Dayle, Thank you so much for your response. I truly appreciate your opinion. I feel much better than when I wrote the note. Writing the note was cathartic for me, and I have had a few discussions with my husband since I wrote to you. We are better off today than we were even a few days ago. When I feel that I am losing hope in the future, I shall read your note again. You have helped me beyond what I can convey in a simple e-mail. Best regards, Paula
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;hr /&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      The advice I recieved from you was amazing. I went through with the biggest step of my life because of you! I am now enjoying a lovely vacation with my new WIFE! Thank you so much.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;hr /&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      You guys and gals are WONDERFUL! I have recieved such great advice here and have told ALL my friends about this site and they love it, too. Thank you for all that you do. You have helped me, and so many others, more then you will ever know.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;hr /&gt;

      Thanks again, I was really lonlier than I realized. Your message was like a cup of fresh clean water to my thirst. Thank you. Have a blessed day. Catherine

    &lt;p&gt;
      I sent a question in and received the best advice that I think I have ever heard in my life! I know that this advice will save my relationship. It seemed like the elder pointed all the places where I was going wrong in my relationship and advised that I might approach them differently! I will really advise all of my troubled friends to the elders, THANK YOU SOOO VERRY MUCH! I believe that you just saved my relationship!
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;hr /&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      I have written and asked advice and I want to thank you for always being here. The advice is always kind and well written. Thank you, thank you, thank you!!!!
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;hr /&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      I was delighted to find out about this group! I savor the memories of my own grandparents and because of them I have a natural attraction to the elderly. To me an elderly person is a hidden treasure waiting to be discovered. Thank you for making access to these treasures more possible.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;hr /&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      This is a great site. To know that there are wonderful people out there that care enough to help a complete stranger. This is what I want to do when I am older.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;hr /&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      I&amp;#8217;m very happy to hear from you it brings my spirit to a new level. I was starting the day depressed until I opened this e-mail and got a good feeling inside that I can over come the things that is hurting me, you see I keep alot of things bottled up inside, it means alot to me, to share my story. Thanks, Noel
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;hr /&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      You are right about everything. Your advice makes a lot of sense to me and gives me a lot to think about. I only wish I found this site before it got the point where I started to devalue my wife&amp;#8217;s opnions and job; it wasn&amp;#8217;t always like this. Jay
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;hr /&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      I am so glad to know that you&amp;#8217;re all out there! I&amp;#8217;m very sentimental, so I cried when I saw the report on your group. In keeping with my New Year&amp;#8217;s resolution to be more grateful, I wanted to say a heartfelt &amp;#8220;Thank You&amp;#8221; to you all out there who are lending your wisdom to those of us who haven&amp;#8217;t gained it.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;hr /&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      You understood my situation perfectly. Thank you for making me feel so much better about myself!! You guys are the greatest! God bless you for doing this service. Thank you seems so inadequate. Sincerely, Joyce

      I would just like to express my sincere thanks to the Holiday for the advice on my relationship worries a few months ago. I have managed to move on from the girl I was seeing and truly express my feelings towards my ex girlfriend. Sadly that has not come to much but at least I tried, and have begun to move on. Thanks again Holiday, Your advice really helped me at a time when I felt I had nobody to turn to. All the best, Danny in the UK

      I would like to sincerely thank Seeley for the insight provided. It made me cry to be understood, when I can&amp;#8217;t even understand myself. Your advise is exactly what I needed to hear. All I need now is to gather the strengh to take your advise. I can never thank you enough&amp;#8230;It feels so good to talk about this! God bless you. Joan

    &lt;p&gt;
      In today&amp;#8217;s world, there are few things that stand out and really hit you. I have to say after checking your site out that what you all do is absolutely wonderful!! To give from your heart and offer advice based on your life experiences is a wonderful service to all ages. I am a public servant (firefighter) and I applaud your actions. May God bless all of you!
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;hr /&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      Wow. That is possibly the best advice you could have possibly given. I have kind of wondered if he did find another girl and was just stringing me along. I really really hope thats not the case. I am still fairly young (22) and you&amp;#8217;re right, I do have a whole lifetime ahead of me&amp;#8230;I do still love this guy but Ive been through enough to think that maybe I should trust my gut feelings (and your advice) and give this up. Thank you so much for the advice and for taking the time out of your day to give it. It means alot.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      I think Elder Wisdom Circle is the best thing I&amp;#8217;ve found on the internet since I got my computer a year ago. I know I will turn to it again and again. I feel like I have a real good friend now. Many thanks, Phyllis

      Kudos to this response from you Hedwig, as it brought tears of joy to my eyes! Such a compassionate response, when I didn&amp;#8217;t even include in my quandry that I&amp;#8217;m an only child. You artfully gave me advice that I have been pushing towards the back of my mind.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;hr /&gt;

      Thank you very much, Beach Bum. Deep down inside I knew this was the right decision for me. Being torn and unable to make a conclusive decision alone though, I needed advice and did not know where to turn. What a godsend to have stumbled upon The Elder Wisdom Circle! Thanks again, Barbara

      Thanks so much to Dayle; it helped just to have a little support and to read that others think I&amp;#8217;m doing the right thing. 🙂 This is a fantastic service! Being able to reach out to a stranger and get a calm, considerate reply means so much. Thanks again:) Kathy

      Thank you so much for your kind response. It brought tears to my eyes to receive kind personal advice from people with wisdom to share. I don&amp;#8217;t have enough people to turn to in life right now and helps to know that there are people who care, even if they don&amp;#8217;t know me. Thank you so much. Sincerely, Bill

      Auntie-M, thanks so much for your wise response. i had tears in my eyes as i read it. my mom died about 13 years ago, and i obviously can&amp;#8217;t get her advice, but yours was so wonderful. thanks. and thanks for telling me that i should not feel guilty, because sometimes, despite the situation, i do.

      This is wonerful advice and I will be looking into all of the information you have provided. I lost my husband in a car accident in 2001 and have been in nothing but bad relationships since. I may be coming back to you for advice in the future. Thanks so much. Helen

      The response to my question was spot on. This web site should be more widely known I would recommend it to anyone.

      Arianne, Thank you so much for your support. Your words help immensely! I will do my best not to blame myself for his issues and I will try hard to take care of myself first and foremost. I can&amp;#8217;t tell you how valuable the Elder Wisdom Circle has been for me. I want to thank you for listening and sharing. Warm Regards, Sue

      Thank you!! Your words (response) were encourgaging and if need be, I will use this service again. Please inform Elder Shreya that I want to adopt her as my grandma.

      Am very happy with your site&amp;#8230; I like the way people counsel. They never make you feel there&amp;#8217;s something wrong with you, unlike some paid professionals. They helped me sort out a few problems of my own. I have used this site several times. I found all the counselors who answered nice, warm and sensible. I like to think in this vast universe, there are people (apart from family and friends) who care about you. This site reassures me there&amp;#8217;s a lot of good out there. Cheers!
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;hr /&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      I love what you&amp;#8217;re doing! Brilliant and long overdue! This type of set-up should be world-wide; goodness knows we all could use the advice and guidance of our elders!
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;hr /&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      Your advice is right on the money and much more interesting to me than most advice columnists. I think it&amp;#8217;s wonderful to share your experiences and wisdom with others. You&amp;#8217;re not just withering away in your wheelchairs. You have decided to make a difference in people&amp;#8217;s lives. Good for you!
    &lt;/p&gt;

      Oh my gosh, that response actually made me cry. I guess I knew it all along that I was doing the right thing I just thought since it ended so horribly I must&amp;#8217;ve done something wrong. Thank you for your insights. Thanks so much for your wonderful advice!

      Dear PicklesMarie, Thank you, thank you, thank you for listening and understanding my situation, without judging me for how I&amp;#8217;ve ended up here. Your letter was an absolute gem and I will keep it forever so I can keep coming back to it &amp;#8211; these are lessons that will last me a lifetime. So much wisdom packed into one email! Thank you again for taking the time to share your life knowledge with me. I wish only the best for you and your loved ones. Peace, Mary

      Rechama I wanted to express a deep gratitude for the response I was given. I so appreciate the frame of love it was written in and the use of words, very eloquent. Thank you for the thought and effort in the reply and I pray someday I will be wise enough to bestow such excellent support.

      Dear Toni, Your advice was just what I needed, it felt like a friend was talking to me I can not get over how comforting and honest this website is. For you to take out your time and respond to my dilema was a god-send&amp;#8230;.and for free. That I feel is the most kindhearted humane thing a person can do. I REALLY appreciate your help I feel I am making the right decision to listen to whatever advice was given to me from your website. Again thank you so much Toni for your response it really makes me cry one less night and feel truly &amp;#8216;touched by angel&amp;#8217;. Sincerely Rebekah

      Thank you for being available for those of us who do not have a wise elder to consult when we need questions. I just know that you have given me the answer! I have asked our local extension office and looked on the internet. I tried everything else the experts recommended, but never hear this and it fits!!!!! Thank you Thank you!!
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;hr /&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      Once again, I have recieved incredibly wise and compassionate advice from elders through this website. I cannot tell you how greatful I am &amp;#8211; to the individual elders, and to the group for being available in this way&amp;#8230;Bless you all, forever!
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;hr /&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      I think this is a marvelous idea! I love the idea of being able to learn from someone more experienced. Americans are often disrespectful of our Senior Citizens. This is so productive on all levels&amp;#8230; AND FREE!!!!!!!
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;hr /&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      I found great advice here from someone who is close &amp; connected in soul though we never met. A quality not easy to find -Brought me back to live my life more fully , stay in the presence but be open for changes along the way. My heart is full of gratitude and love -May all beings be happy &amp;#8211; D.

      I have recently asked two questions lately, and I just want to thank everyone at EWC for running this service. It has been a big help. It is always nice to get an opinion on an issue by an outside source, especially when it is something that I would rather not involve or inform my friends or family members about the topic. Keep up the great work!
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;hr /&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      I received a very thoughtful response for advise regarding a sleeping co-worker. I thank you for the response. In reading through the responses to others I wanted to say what a great service to others you are providing. I think you are helping to make the world a better place. Thanks for your time.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;hr /&gt;

      I just want to thank any of the Elders who have helped me in my most confusing times. It&amp;#8217;s hard to find good advice and i&amp;#8217;m glad there&amp;#8217;s a place where I can ask my most secret and confusing questions and get real advice from someone with the expereince and wisdom. THANK YOU!

      Dear Jacobus, I am very grateful for your knowledge about marriage. I am happy to see this from a mans side also. I don&amp;#8217;t talk to my husband about school much because It is stressful for him to think about it. I am so grateful for Elder Wisdom Circle, It&amp;#8217;s like reaching into the past to ask my grandparents what I should do. They have been gone since the 1970s and I miss thier wisdom as well as thier love. This website has a very healing effect on me. Thank you from the bottom of my heart! Your friend, Kathey
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;hr /&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      I want to thank all of you! You all do such a wonderful job! Your advice has helped me believe people that has told me some of the same things but I guess it took hearing it from someone else. Your all so generous to take time to help people like me that are lost and have no one to turn to. I thank-you all again~Heather
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;hr /&gt;

      This website is amazing. I asked for some advice once and was very impressed with the response I got. It is so refreshing to hear unbiased advice from someone on the outside. Keep up the good work!
    &lt;/p&gt;

      I want to say thank you to all the Elders at EWC! I just turned thirteen a few months ago, and found my life to seem to get harder. With plenty of friendship problems, and just stuff in everyday life, I found EWC the best place to turn to! I got advice within 3 days of sending in my question, and I used that advice! I never use any other advice! And, the advice worked! I know it will be a long time, but when I&amp;#8217;m an elder, I know this is what I want to do! Work for EWC!
    &lt;/p&gt;

      My sister and I want to extent our thanks to Marnie for her advice regarding our &amp;#8216;absentee&amp;#8217; mother. With bare facts presented, Marnie was able to identify the core of hurt feelings we share and offer the appropriate advice we needed. We feel blessed to know that even though our mother isn&amp;#8217;t there for us (to ask advice, etc), that someone like Marnie is extending herself to those who need it. Thank you for &amp;#8216;mothering&amp;#8217; us, in a time where we just needed it. Kimberly and Jennifer

      Dear Rose, Thank you so much for responding to my letter. I&amp;#8217;m actually crying right now because of your compassion and your wisdom, particularly as it related to A.A. Thank you for the words, &amp;#8220;you deserve to be cherished&amp;#8221; also, as you pointed out, I do feel that I&amp;#8217;m rationalizing, minimizing, and excusing his behavior. Your advice came at exactly the right time. I think I&amp;#8217;ll look for an A.A. meeting online right now! Thank you, thank you a million times. Diane

      Dear Apple Annie, I am so touched by your advice. I feel like there are guardian angels listening to my problems, and I feel more connected than I have! Thank you for your advice, it was very clear and I want to use that structure, of having a written agreement. Thank you! Amy

      Hello Tell-Tom, Wow, that reply you sent me, it really gives me hope. Im going to keep that email forever; and I hope to look back on it one day and say to myself Its true. Your response has made me more confident to be who I am. You say my true love is the someone who loves me for who I am, for being responsible with my disabled sisters and family.Your kids are lucky to have a dad like you and your grandkids are lucky to have a grandad like you.

      Thank you for the empathetic response to my very long-winded request for help. Since writing it, I do feel better, appreciate having the opportunity for the perspective, and benefited from the thoughtful response. Jackie, you made me feel as though I was sitting with a friend at a table, getting sense knocked into me over a cup of coffee (or a glass of wine, depending!). I value your observations and know I have survived in a very blessed way. Thank you for providing very valuable insight to those seeking help.

      In response to Article #: 45843, I must admit it brought tears to my eyes. In a world of a seemingly futile existence being a gay man, to hear hear an elder give advice such as this moves me. In our community, the senior community is generally viewed as the backbone of the republican party but changes when we think of our &amp;#8220;Oma&amp;#8217;s &amp; Opa&amp;#8217;s&amp;#8221;. I applaud each one of you for the work you do and the advice you give which is non-partisan. KEEP UP THE GREAT WORK, WE NEED YOU!!!

      I wanted to send a thank you for the response I got on how to help a friend who has been abused by her parents. Both letters gave very helpful information and they also had a very sincere and meaningful quality to them. It is a shock to my senses to know that such a completely selfless organization exists. I feel a bit more at peace knowing that people like those at the EWC are out there. Thank you again for your prompt responses. Thank you Bailey, Rose, and everyone else helping with EWC. ~Kathryn

      Thank you very much. You advice was right on. He called the other day and things seem fine. We&amp;#8217;re back to talking all the time and the nightly &amp;#8220;goodnight&amp;#8221; phone calls and text messages. I&amp;#8217;m still confused because no guy I know calls a girl daily &amp;#8220;just because&amp;#8221; and calls to say hes home. But I am just going with the flow and enjoying it.

      I just wanted to thank all of the wonderful elders here! A little over one year ago I wrote asking for advice on how to propose to my boyfriend. I took the advice received, got down on one knee and asked him to marry me during the fireworks New Years Eve 1 year and 2+ months ago. As of this April we will have been married for 1 year, and are so happy together. Women don&amp;#8217;t propose often, so I was very glad to have some advice on how to make it special for him. 🙂 As a side note, we were both accepted into PhD programs at the U of Georgia, where I have added a Geronotology Certificate to my area of study. Keep kickin&amp;#8217; butt! Ruthie
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;hr /&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      I think what you are doing is so wonderful. I can hardly put it into words. I&amp;#8217;m also sitting here with tears in my eyes so forgive me if my typing gets all garbled. My grandparents died when I was very young. The only one I remember lived until I was 12, which wasn&amp;#8217;t long enough. I am 30 now and I still miss her and I wish so much that I could ask her about my problems. She was a sweet lady and I know we would only have grown closer over the years. I am so touched that your group is using its collective wisdom to give good advice to people who need it. It&amp;#8217;s about the kindest thing I&amp;#8217;ve ever heard of. You have made my day. Thank you for doing what you do. Sincerely, Jessica

      Dear Elder Web, thank you so much for your excellent advice. I know in my heart that you are right on target, and I will follow your suggestions. Special thanks and appreciation to the Elder Wisdom Circle, for all the good they do in the world. I learned of the Circle on an NPR program, and have spread the word to my friends. The existence of this Circle is truly Good News, in a world that is starving for good news. Marcie

      Thank you, Rinchu. I have been having a problem on and off over a year. I was at a loss as to how to solve this problem and was quite upset about it. A bit of advice from Rinchu&amp;#8211;problem solved! I printed the e-mail from Rinchu and used a pen to highlight the advice that I felt I really needed to concentrate on. When I felt confused about my situation, I simply referred to the e-mail. Rinchu explained to me the cold, hard facts, but in a very kind and gentle way. It seems the older I get, the smarter my elders get. Listen up you young whipper-snappers&amp;#8211;these folks know what they are talking about! MJ

      I cannot thank you enough for your wise and sage advice. You were absolutely right! I finally bit the bullet and spoke to my boyfriend. He was apologetic and a bit ashamed. He has IMMEDIATELY turned around. He is the guy I knew he could be, that I wanted. All it took was for me to stand up for myself, and I owe that to you! Thanks again and agian!!! Yours truly, Natasha

      Friend, WOW. Such excellent writing, too! Not only insightful points, but lucid writing. I think your points were too many, and I could not try to summarize. But what I learned is that I am not completely independent, and I should not try to be. I need people, I need my body, and I need my health. Enjoy my dreams, but share. That is what I learned. Thank you, my elder friend! Best, Ryan

      Hello, First of all, I would like to thank the circle for taking the time to look through my letter and to reply to it. I am a student of engineering (2nd year ) and i thought that at this point in life , if I did not know which way to head, I was indeed a loser ( because engineering is not my first love). Indeed I do not know now as yet but I intend to wait it out. I would specially like to thank Grandma-Dan for her reply&amp;#8230;..she has been very kind in her reply and she was so very correct in identifying the fact that I am scared of showing my emotions. I intend to follow her advice about making decisions.Indeed she has been most sympathetic and I am really glad I applied to the council . Thank you once again . Reetoditee (Kolkata,India)

      Thank you so much for the valuable advice, feedback &amp; tremendous insight. I think this elder has hit it right on the head, so to speak and I wanted to let you know. I might ask for more advice from this elder as I am going through a difficult time right now trying to stay true to myself while at the same time trying to have some level of patience within my relationship. Thank you again. Sincerely, Michelle

      I just wanted to thank you so much for your advice. I didn&amp;#8217;t even think of doing those things until you said it!

      Orchids to you and to ALL the Elders. It was a great comfort to talk to someone who&amp;#8217;s had a few more spins around the block than I have. In exactly 20 more years, I&amp;#8217;ll be eligible to be an elder. Perhaps someday I&amp;#8217;LL get to be one of you. What a great thing to aspire to. You are all heroes! God bless each and every one of you!!

      Rose, I&amp;#8217;m amazed by your brilliance. You know, all my grandparents are dead, and my parents just wouldn&amp;#8217;t understand. I have nobody to talk to about certain things, and in a way, you&amp;#8217;re sort of like my grandparent. So thank you for everything. Samantha

      Rose, Thank you for such a quick response! I was happy to see your advice, I had suspected some of the same issues, but couldn&amp;#8217;t seem to convince anyone else of what I thought was happening. Thank you for your advice, this is a fantastic service, I plan on consulting EWC in the future! Regards, Mia

      I wish to thank you all very much. It just so happens that I pretty much came to the same decision. My husband and I are trying to work things out. However, your advice was wonderful. It just reaffirmed what I thought and I want to thank you for taking the time to help a poor soul as myself. Tee

      Thank you so much! I think this web site is fantastic. I appreciate the advice and I think I am going to opt for protecting my skin rather than get a tan.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;hr /&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      Thanks very much for the advice. Your advice was very good considering the short details that I gave. As I think about it I think the sex makes me feel good about myself and really helps me to compensate for other parts of my life that are not as fulfilling. Again I appreciate your advice and thanks for being there for me. Eric

    &lt;hr /&gt;

      Thank you very much for your precious advice you gave me. I will try my best to do what you suggested and revert back to you if I am not able to cope which I am sure wont be necessary. Thank you once again for the fantastic job you do. May be I will need your valuable advice again in future. Bye Khushi

I am so glad that your response was quick, as soon as I read the first few lines I had to stop and cry because I have felt so very bad about feeling like I want to go on and live a full happy life with out Michael. I only fear that he will not make it easy. He is still here and we all three live in our own rooms. I&amp;#8217;m looking for the right time to ask him to please move out. He did not give me any money to pay the house bills, so i paid them all. My next step is to ask my family for support and to help me move him out. Blessings to Rinchu and i truly thank you for your advice. The web site was God sent. I really felt Rinchu talking to me, Thank you! you have a friend for life! I&amp;#8221;m going to be just fine!

I just wanted to let you know, so you could have an end to this mess! thank you so much, I reccommend your group all the time. Thanks again, Connie

      Dawn, Thank you, thank you, thank you for your wonderful advice!!! It was as if you knew exactly what I was feeling and your kind words helped me to refocus and remember what was really important! You&amp;#8217;re ight&amp;#8230;life changes and circles of friends do as well and yes, she does still include me in things. I almost made a huge mistake but, thanks to you&amp;#8230;.well, let&amp;#8217;s just say that I will heed your advice!
    &lt;/p&gt;

      Rose, Thank you for your time. Thank you also for the advice. Your experiences inspired me to stay on the path that I chose for myself. Thank you for making a difference during a time when a decision seems impossible. It&amp;#8217;s funny how a stranger can help somone on such a deep level. PS. I love the name Rose. Joanne

      This is one of the most awesome ideas I&amp;#8217;ve run across. I&amp;#8217;ve worked in alot of Social Service settings and understand the wisdom available from our elderly; but to see it focused like this; great!
    &lt;/p&gt;

      Thank you so much..you are right&amp;#8230;I will move on and hopefully find a guy that is attainable and try not to set myself up for sorrow. You really helped me get things in perspective. Thanks
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;hr /&gt;

      Dear Heart of Texas, Thank you so much for your advice. I think you are right about me being scared after seeing failing relationships from family members and stuff. I agree with everything you said..and it feels really good to hear it from someone else. You are wonderful..thank you so much. This advice will carry on with me for the next relationship with a guy that i encounter. Thanks again! Kristina

I think the advice you gave me is perfect and I willpray and really try to follow whatever the answer is. It is very hard for me not to care what people think of me but I will try to carry on by doing the best I can in whatever it is. I&amp;#8217;ll let u know how I make out in the coming weeks. Thankyou very much. Betty

      Dear Rose, I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart for considering my dilemma and giving me your advice. You made some very good points that I had not considered. I do believe I will go to dental school and I intend to reward my precious family in everyway possible for their sacrifices. I wish you and your family a happy and healthy new year. Best regards, Juli
    &lt;/p&gt;

God bless you for your kind heart! I will write about the situation to you as soon as I return home,you see I am going to visit my family in few days,but we still didn&amp;#8217;t tell the in-laws about the trip,coz I am afraid they will do somehting bad,fake something.we are going to send them sms on their mobile and after that phone them.the thing is they think that I just want to kidnap my own kid and run away,living my husband alone-the most pathetic thing I have ever heard!that is why we didnt tell them about the trip yet. anyway,Happy New Year to all who is always there for people like me:)

    &lt;p&gt;
      Thank you for your advice. I appreciate you understanding the difficult nature of this conflict. I took your advice and realized that I did not need this relationship anymore. At some moments I miss it, but for the most part, I celebrate myself and being strong enough to start the new year with only those people who are right and good for me. Thank you for your encouraging words and for providing the wisdom I needed when I needed it. Thank you!
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;hr /&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      I would just like to send my thanks to you. Having someone else, that has seen this kind of thing before, tell me that I am on the right path, truly helps ease the pain.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;hr /&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      I cannot tell you how happy I was to get your reply. It was so generous of you to take the time and write, as well as give thought to a stranger&amp;#8217;s plight. Thank you and I will certainly consider it; it was very helpful and wise. Best regards. Juli

      I just wanted to say to all these seniors thank you. My generation so often throws there grandparents away. You folks knew something my generation will never get to taste, self respect, goodness, honestness, faithfulness, real family, dicipline, knowing what helping your neighbor just because it was the humane thing to do feels like, just an all around bigger sense of respect in the full aspect of the word. Respect for everyone and most of all yourselves. It seems the trend today is the opposite destruction. I was raised by my grandparents and I would give anything for five more minutes! My name is Chrissy and I&amp;#8217;m 25 and personally salute every one of you fine relics. The knowledge of life each one of you possess, the stories are worth more than all money and could never be substituted. So, thanks for giving out life&amp;#8217;s lessons for free!! And remember if you&amp;#8217;re all alone and you think no one is thinking of you. Someone is thinking of you and praying for you!!! God Bless
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;hr /&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      I would just like to once again thank Elder CHR and ElderWisdomCircle for their amazing service!
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;hr /&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      I just wanted to say thank you for your insight. It means so much to me to have such insightful advice, which I definitely will take into serious consideration. Again, I really appreciate you taking the time to help me with my difficult situation. -Christina
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;hr /&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      Thank you so much for your response to my problem. It is comforting to know there are people that we can ask for advise. I don&amp;#8217;t know what is going to happen, but I will take everything you both have offered into consideration and hope my husband sees the light. Thank you again. Loretta
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;hr /&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      Thank you so very much. Not only have you answered my questions but you have taken my breath away with your poetic response. I have felt that these were the signs but to hear someone actually put my thoughts into words really confirms that LOVE exists. Thanks again.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;hr /&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      Jacobus and Elder Circle, Thank you SO much for your wonderful response. What an amazing group you have established. Jacobus, your advice, though simple, was powerful, and it was important for me to hear you say that there is not a malicious person in the bunch of us. That is something I need to remember about my friend and brother both. Michelle
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;hr /&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      Rose, Wow! The reply to my question was better than I had imagined! You said exactly what I know in my heart to be true, that I need to end this relationship I&amp;#8217;m in, but I really needed to hear someone else tell me I was right. You provided just that reassurance- and went beyond! I was a little uncertain about using this service but it was incredible. Thank you so much! -Shannon
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;hr /&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      I just want to say thank you Michelle. Your advice hit on things I was failing to recognize. It is my own insecurity driving me and I have spoken with him on some of these things since I sent in my request. I am more aware now of the things that are my issues and not his. And I will take your advice about my visit. I had not thought beyond just seeing him again. Thanks again. I hope you are well. Sincerely, Rachael
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;hr /&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      Dear Jacobus, Thank you so much for your reply and your advice. I understand and realise that my thoughts about expressing how I felt to this man were infact born from a deeper desire to hurt him and theres no way that could ever bring anyone peace!. I understand that now. Thank you also for reminding me about the Serenity Prayer &amp;#8211; my Mother kept a copy of it beside her bed so it&amp;#8217;s a great comfort to be reminded of it. Best Regards Gem
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      Kudos. Unfortunately, I was unable to wait for this very sane and intelligent request. I told my husband of my upsetment this morning and a very hostile fight ensued. When I received this reply last night, I read it to him and acknowledged we both were in the wrong. Me for being &amp;#8220;cruel and rude&amp;#8221;, him for being a &amp;#8220;blockhead&amp;#8221;. I hope I won&amp;#8217;t have to come back to your sight, which is unrealistic, but I certainly would. Thank you, when I didn&amp;#8217;t know where else to turn. Debbie

    &lt;p&gt;
      Thank you so much Pearls of Wisdom! I can&amp;#8217;t tell you how much it means to know that someone else thinks my instincts are right. It&amp;#8217;s a hard fight to fight. I appreciate your time &amp; insight more than you&amp;#8217;ll know. Peace, Michelle
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;hr /&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      HA! What an excellent idea. I never would have thought of that in a million years&amp;#8230; I&amp;#8217;ll give it a try and see what happens, Thank you 🙂 Courtney
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;hr /&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      Thank you so much for your advice. I really appreciate your nonjudgmental reply. I just knew I couldn&amp;#8217;t ask any of my family and friends, they would only side with me, and that&amp;#8217;s not what I wanted, I wanted the truth as to wheather I was being selfish or if I had a legit. complaint. I appreciate your time.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;hr /&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      My goodness, this answers the main questions I needed. I sooooooooo appreciate your kindness and your honesty in your response back to me. Even as I was sending the original message&amp;#8230;I was ready to let her know the truth. My appreciation again. Much thanks
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;hr /&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      Thank you for your words of encouragement. I think I am going to give it a try. I am unhappy with my situation and I want to do somthing to change it. I&amp;#8217;m just filled with so much doubt, it really helps to read your words. Thank you.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;hr /&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      Hi to the Elder Wisdom Circle and to L. David&amp;#8211; I really want to thank you for your quick reply, but even more than that, for just being out there. What an outstanding resource you are! This is the second time I&amp;#8217;ve consulted with someone at your site and both times were equally excellent. This particular response was so kind and so straightforward. I am grateful. Please keep up the terrific work. Your site and your service are very much needed and appreciated! All the best, Melly
    &lt;/p&gt;

      Hi Helen, Thank you so much for your reply! Its funny, its like you read my mind. You are right,I definitely have to see where this will go. EWC is such a great idea! Thanks so much for your great advice, Temple
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;hr /&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      Thank you, despite getting it between the eyes, it was what I needed. I did realise I was &amp;#8216;cheating&amp;#8217; but perhaps rationalised it as an amusement. The advice was fair, balanced and helpful. Thanks John
    &lt;/p&gt;

      Dear EWC, Just wanted to let you know that I became engaged last night!!! He had planned on proposing the past 2 months!! I also had my interview for school (PhD in Clinical Psych) and it went well. Thanks so much for your advice&amp;#8211;you brought up valid points, but now we know that indecision was not an issue! Sincerely, Amy
    &lt;/p&gt;

      I would like to personally thank both elder Rose and Jacobus for their incredibly insightful responses to my dilemma. Not even have ever met these people, I feel like they have known me and those invloved in my situation for many years. They gave me pure, serious and piercing insight and truly helped me realize the best path to take. I truly thank and bless them both for their advice and heart-felt wisdom. Chances are they saved three relationships. Truly wonderful they are. Nick

      In 2003 I wrote an email about my White boyfriend and his racist stepfather. I&amp;#8217;m half black and half latina, and my boyfriend never had the guts to let his stepfather know. WO Owl said that Johnny (my boyfriend) had to learn to be a man and let his stepdad know about me. Well, it took almost 2 years but finally it happened. This Thanksgiving I went to his mom and stepdad&amp;#8217;s house. I was introduced to Steve (stepdad) and he was very gracious with me. He never made me feel any different and was actually nice. When we left, I gave him my hand and said &amp;#8220;It was good meeting you&amp;#8221; and he surprised me by giving me a big bear hug. I wanted to share that with you all and especially to WO Owl who took the time to respond to my mail. God Bless&amp;#8230;Wendy
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;hr /&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      I thank you, and now I know where to turn for other issues that might come up. You are a great organization and if I had any money, I would donate as much as I could. Keep up the great work. You really put my mind at ease just knowing there is someone to talk to.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;hr /&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      Dear Treefrog, I&amp;#8217;m so greatful with your advice (so fast too!), that&amp;#8217;s exactly what I&amp;#8217;m going to do, and what I needed to hear. I wish you blessings and hapiness. Thank you from the bottom of my heart. Sharon
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;hr /&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      I would like to thank Rose for her kind and thoughtful advice. I needed to hear from someone with a fresh perspective and I received it from her. Thank you soo much! You are a beautiful person!
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;hr /&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;
      You all are a real blessing. I am mailing a contribution to the work you do, because it is very important. I really needed to hear from you and I am glad that you were straightforward with me. Much Love!
    &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
